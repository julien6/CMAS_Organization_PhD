# About Cyberdefense Multi-Agent System Organization (Autonomous Intelligent Cyberdefense Agent - AICA)

## TODO: CCGRID2025, CLOSER2025

## Topic description

**Context**:
- Need to ensure Cyberdefense in distributed, heterogeneous networked systems: IoT (drones swarm, domotic) or classical infrastructures while centralized solution show to be inefficient.
- Carried out architectural works for an AICA agent that is to be deployed on networked systems to ensure Cyberdefense.
- Current AICA architecture should be revised to take advantage of a multi-agent approach in order to address issues related to decentralization, distribution, scalability, adaptability...

**Problem**:
- We consider an AICA agent is a particular case of a Cybedefense Multi-Agent System (CMAS) that is made up from a set of cyber-defender agents collaborating together to reach their cyber-goal.
- **What are the organizations among cyber-defender agents, so the resulting CMAS can be deployed and operate under the networked environment constraints in order to reach its cyber-goal?**

**Expected contributions**
- **Academic**: Organizational mechanisms of a CMAS taking into account the deployment and operational constraints in environment and the cyber-goal to reach.
- **Industrial**: A method and a tool to develop CMAS for given networked environment and cyber-goals in order to help in various case studies.

**Related works in literature**:
- No works dealing with organization of a CMAS...

**Litterature approach to address the problem**
- For each work dealing with a CMAS, we tried to establish trends between the core CMAS organization, networked environment and cyber-goal
    - Results not meaningful: not enough works, too specific, not consistent, subjective analyze...

**General academic contribution roadmap**
1) Established a study framework consisting in a networked environment with blue, red, and green teams
2) Established a formalization of the study framework with related Cyberdefense and MAS concepts through a Dec-POMDP model
3) Established a methodological approach to design, implement, and assess several types of blue team organizations to know what organization to foster for given networked environment and cyber-goal
4) Established a simulation/emulation tool to support the approach

**General industrial contirbution roadmap**
1) Adapt the methodological approach to help in designing organization in light of drawn trends between organization, networked environment and cyber-goals
2) Adapt the simulation/emulation tool with means to help in designing, implementing, assessing and deploying a CMAS by relying on the adapted methodological approach
