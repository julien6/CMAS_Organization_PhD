    Autonomous Cyber Defense is increasingly critical in protecting decentralized environments where centralized approaches are impractical. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in training agents to achieve collective objectives without explicit organizational designs. However, enhancing the explainability and robustness of MARL in complex environments, such as cyberdefense scenarios, remains challenging. This paper introduces PRAHOM, an algorithmic approach that integrates the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model into the MARL process. PRAHOM constrains agents' policies according to organizational specifications derived from joint histories, ensuring alignment with predefined roles and missions. We apply PRAHOM to a cyberdefense scenario from the CAGE Challenge 3, involving a drone swarm facing malware attacks. The results demonstrate that PRAHOM can effectively guide the training of agents to detect, mitigate, and eliminate malware while adhering to organizational constraints, enhancing the swarm's resilience and operational effectiveness.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\textit{Autonomous Intelligent Cyberdefense Agents}~\cite{Kott2023} are agents to be deployed in a networked environment to detect, identify and characterize anomalies/attacks, develop and manage the execution of countermeasures and communicate with the outside world
%
\footnote{
    Theorized by the \textit{AICA International Work Group}.(cf. \url{https://www.aica-iwg.org/}) and built on the results of NATO's \textit{Research Task Group IST-152}
    % which worked on the concept \textquote{Intelligent, Autonomous and Trusted Agents for Cyber Defense and Resilience}.
}.
%
Research for the AICA development highlights the increasingly need of \textit{Autonomous Cyber Defense} for protecting decentralized environments where traditional centralized approaches are ineffective, such as in IoT-based systems. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) offers robust and adaptive defense mechanisms by decomposing the cyberdefense complexity into sub-task delegated to collaborative agents deployed all over a system to defend.

One approach focuses on designing a MAS for cyberdefense in a top-down manner, starting from predefined architectures and functionalities. Indeed, the \textit{MAS Centric AICA Reference Architecture} (MASCARA)~\cite{Kott2023} describes AICA-like MAS with components enabling collaborative mechanisms based on explicitly defined plans or processes. Yet, this approach proves to be costly for it requires some knowledge of the deployment environment in addition to take into account frequent changes such as changes in topology or new vulnerabilities.

Alternatively, other works have shown Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)~\cite{Albrecht2024} as an effective way for agents learn to achieve cyberdefense goals by themselves, enhancing the MAS autonomy. Despite promising results in simulations, this approach still lacks safety guarantees necessary for real systems applications nor does it provide explicit means to justify the MAS success or failure.
%Indeed, trained agents may have organizational aspects such as roles, plans or hierarchical links, which are not inherently explicit.
%
These concerns hinder any further development of a fully/semi-autonomous cyberdefense MAS, such as for an AICA agent, in highly critical and dynamic environments since actions made must be justified regarding their potential irreversible consequences.

We propose an algorithmic approach to integrate the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model into the MARL framework through trajectories/histories, called \textit{Partial Relation between Agents' History and Organizational Model} (PRAHOM). PRAHOM is primarily to guide the training of agents to adhere to specific roles and missions, possibly enhancing the MAS performance. It enables adding a kind of embedded monitoring framework by incorporating domain-specific knowledge, such as rules or protocols, into the training process.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of PRAHOM through a case study based on the 3rd CAGE Challenge~\cite{cage_challenge_3_announcement}, which involves creating a cyberdefense MAS for detecting, mitigating, and eliminating malware programs in a drone swarm. We applied PRAHOM adapting MASCARA into  $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational specifications for this scenario. We verified trained agents exhibit expected collective strategies while being also fine-tuned throughout the training making the overall score to be comparable to leading ones of the leaderboard.

The remainder is organized as follows. \Autoref{sec:related_works} reviews works related to MARL taking into account organizational considerations. \Autoref{sec:marl_moise_linking} recaps the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model and presents the underlying principles for linking it to MARL. \Autoref{sec:prahom_theory} introduces the PRAHOM algorithm. \Autoref{sec:experimental_setup} presents an overview of our \textit{Proof of Concept} PRAHOM implementation and its use for the experimental setup involving MASCARA-based organizational specifications for the 3rd CAGE Challenge. \Autoref{sec:results_and_discussion} discusses the results. Finally, \Autoref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.



\section{Related works}
\label{sec:related_works}

We first introduce the basics of MARL as a foundation of the main contribution.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)}

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) extends the principles of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to scenarios involving multiple interacting agents. Each agent aims to maximize its own cumulative reward through learning, but the presence of other agents introduces additional complexity due to the dynamic nature of the environment.

MARL is often modeled using the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), a framework suitable for environments where agents have limited and differing observations. A Dec-POMDP is formally defined as a tuple $(S, \{A_i\}, T, R, \{\Omega_i\}, O, \gamma)$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$: A finite set of states describing the environment.
    \item $\{A_i\}$: A set of action sets, one for each agent $i$.
    \item $T$: The state transition probability function $T(s, \vec{a}, s') = P(s'|s, \vec{a})$, where $\vec{a}$ is the joint action of all agents.
    \item $R$: The reward function $R(s, \vec{a}, s')$, mapping states and actions to a reward.
    \item $\{\Omega_i\}$: A set of observation sets, one for each agent $i$.
    \item $O$: The observation probability function $O(\vec{o} | s', \vec{a})$, where $\vec{o}$ is the joint observation of all agents.
    \item $\gamma \in [0,1]$: The discount factor for future rewards.
\end{itemize}

In MARL, each agent $i$ maintains a policy $\pi_i: H_i \rightarrow A_i$, mapping its observation history $H_i$ to actions. Joint policies $\pi = (\pi_1, \pi_2, \ldots, \pi_n)$ describe the behavior of all agents collectively.

Several approaches exist for solving MARL problems, often categorized into value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic methods.

\paragraph{Value-Based Methods}

Value-based methods, such as Q-learning, extend to the multi-agent context through techniques like Independent Q-learning (IQL) and Joint Action Learners (JAL). These methods estimate the value function $Q(s, \vec{a})$, representing the expected cumulative reward for state $s$ and joint action $\vec{a}$.

\paragraph{Policy-Based Methods}

Policy-based methods directly parameterize the policy $\pi_{\theta}$ with parameters $\theta$, and optimize $\theta$ to maximize the expected return. Multi-agent policy gradient methods, like MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient), introduce centralized training with decentralized execution, using a critic that considers the actions and observations of all agents during training.

\paragraph{Actor-Critic Methods}

Actor-critic methods combine value-based and policy-based approaches. The actor updates the policy parameters in the direction suggested by the critic, which evaluates the current policy. In the multi-agent setting, COMA (Counterfactual Multi-Agent Policy Gradients) employs a centralized critic to compute counterfactual baselines, reducing the variance of policy gradient estimates.

\subsubsection{Optimization Objectives}

Key optimization objectives in MARL include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Maximizing Expected Cumulative Reward}: Finding policies $\pi_i$ that maximize the expected cumulative reward $U(\pi) = \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, \vec{a}_t)\right]$.
    \item \textbf{Best Response (BR)}: Identifying policies that form a best response to the policies of other agents.
    \item \textbf{Sufficient Response (SR)}: Finding policies that achieve a satisfactory level of reward, often used in approximate solutions.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Related works to organizational-oriented MARL}

MARL has garnered substantial attention for its ability to train multiple agents to collaborate or compete in shared environments. Prominent algorithms such as MADDPG~\cite{lowe2017multi}, MAPPO~\cite{yu2022surprising}, and Q-MIX~\cite{rashid2018qmix} have demonstrated effectiveness through interactions with the environment and other agents, often without explicit consideration of organizational structures or predefined roles.

We define organizational-oriented MARL as the broad field of research gathering works that involve introducing explicit specifications, such as roles, plans, or protocols, to guide or constrain the MARL training process in order to meet these requirements. The integration of organizational specifications in MARL is not largely addressed explicitly in literature. Yet, various approaches have been proposed to incorporate organizational constraints in MAS to ensure agents adhere to certain requirements.

\

\textbf{Learning with Organizational Constraints} \quad
%
The integration of organizational constraints into the learning process of agents has been explored to various extents. In \cite{cruz2020norms}, the authors present a method for incorporating norms into the learning algorithms of agents, ensuring that their behavior remains within acceptable bounds. Additionally, \cite{villatoro2011social} proposes a mechanism for agents to learn and adapt to social norms in dynamic environments, highlighting the importance of norm adaptation in MAS.

A relevant work set belong to the \emph{Specification-Guided Reinforcement Learning} that aims to generate policies that accomplish a specific task using external specifications to guide learning in achieving an objective under given constraints~\cite{Bansal2022}. Jothimurugan et al.~\cite{Jothimurugan2021} propose logical specification learning as exploiting the compositional structure of specifications to generate policies for complex tasks.

\textbf{Policy-Based Approaches} \quad
%
Policy-based approaches provide a way to enforce organizational constraints by defining explicit policies that govern agent behavior. In \cite{krupanski2015norm}, the use of normative policies is investigated to guide agent interactions and decision-making processes. Moreover, \cite{vos2020governing} explores the use of governance mechanisms to enforce compliance with organizational policies in decentralized systems.

\textbf{Evaluation and Applications} \quad
%
Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of organizational models and policies in various applications. For example, \cite{dignum2004agent} evaluates the application of organizational models in e-commerce systems, demonstrating their utility in ensuring reliable and predictable agent behavior. Similarly, \cite{andrighetto2013normative} investigates the role of normative systems in regulating agent behavior in collaborative environments.

\textbf{Frameworks Integrating Organizational Aspects} \quad
%
Wang et al.~\cite{Wang2020} introduce an approach in which similar emerging roles are pushed to jointly specialize in specific tasks. Tosic et al.~\cite{Tosic2010} propose a framework for coordination based on the communication capabilities of multi-agent systems. Zheng et al.~\cite{Zheng2018} present a platform for MARL that aims to facilitate research on artificial collective intelligence by providing a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics to compare the performance of MARL algorithms.

\

Despite these advancements, there is still a scarcity of research explicitly utilizing organizational specifications to constrain agent learning in accordance with requirements. To our knowledge, no existing work facilitates the generation of a MAS that explicitly satisfies additional organizational constraints. PRAHOM's originality is to use an organizational model explicitly as a general way for constraining learning based on these requirements.

\section{Linking MARL and the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model}\label{sec:marl_moise_linking}

The $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ model~\cite{Hubner2007} provides a comprehensive framework for specifying the structure and interactions within a Multi-Agent System (MAS). We utilize $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ due to its compatibility with MARL and its formal description capabilities for agents' policies. The PRAHOM approach bridges the gap between MARL and organizational modeling by embedding $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ specifications into the MARL training process. This integration allows for the training of agents that adhere to predefined organizational roles and missions.

In $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$, \textbf{Organizational Specifications (OS)} are defined as $\mathcal{OS} = \langle \mathcal{SS}, \mathcal{FS}, \mathcal{DS} \rangle$, where $\mathcal{SS}$ are the \textbf{Structural Specifications}, $\mathcal{FS}$ are the \textbf{Functional Specifications}, and $\mathcal{DS}$ are the \textbf{Deontic Specifications}.

\subsection{Structural specifications and constraining joint-policies according to roles}

\textbf{Structural Specifications (SS)} describe the organizational structure and are denoted as $\mathcal{SS} = \langle \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{IR}, \mathcal{G} \rangle$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{R}_{ss}$: The set of all roles ($\rho \in \mathcal{R}$).
    \item $\mathcal{IR}: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$: The inheritance relation between roles ($\rho_1 \sqsubset \rho_2$).
    \item $\mathcal{RG} \subseteq \mathcal{GR}$: The set of root groups, $\mathcal{GR} = \langle \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{SG}, \mathcal{L}^{intra}, \mathcal{L}^{inter}, \mathcal{C}^{intra}, \mathcal{C}^{inter}, np, ng \rangle$, where:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_{ss}$: The set of non-abstract roles.
              \item $\mathcal{SG} \subseteq \mathcal{GR}$: The set of sub-groups.
              \item $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{TL}$: The set of links $(\rho_s, \rho_d, t)$, where $t \in \{acq, com, aut\}$ indicates the type of link (acquaintance, communication, authority).
              \item $\mathcal{L}^{intra} \subseteq \mathcal{L}$: The set of intra-group links.
              \item $\mathcal{L}^{inter} \subseteq \mathcal{L}$: The set of inter-group links.
              \item $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{R}$: The set of compatibilities $(\rho_a \bowtie \rho_b)$.
              \item $\mathcal{C}^{intra} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$: The set of intra-group compatibilities.
              \item $\mathcal{C}^{inter} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$: The set of inter-group compatibilities.
              \item $np: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$: The cardinality of agents adopting a role.
              \item $ng: \mathcal{SG} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$: The cardinality of each sub-group.
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_1}$} \quad Roles need to be represented by policies in MARL, addressing the lack of common ground between policies and roles to determine expected agent behavior.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_1}$} \quad We propose mapping a role to a history subset using the $rh: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(H)$ bijection to show how an agent's policy should generate histories belonging to an expected history subset when playing a role.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \input{figures/PRAHOM_osm_rels.tex}
    \caption{Relations between organizational specifications and history subsets}
    \label{fig:PRAHOM_osm_rels}
\end{figure}

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_2}$} \quad Representing complex behaviors with large history subsets is impracticable due to exponential complexity and handling non-convenient large observations or actions.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_{2.1}}$} \quad Using labels to represent observations, we introduce $ol: \mathcal{P}(\Omega) \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(L)$ to map simple strings to real observations. The relation $bld_{ol}$ enables creating a labels-observations mapping.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \input{figures/ol_scheme.tex}
    \caption{Observations-labels mapping and its creation}
    \label{fig:PRAHOM_ol}
\end{figure}

\

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_{2.2}}$} \quad Simplify history subsets as constraints on policy $c\pi \in c\Pi$ by introducing an observable policy constraint $c\pi: H \times \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(A)$. The relation $bld_{opc}: \mathcal{P}(H) \rightarrow c\Pi$ enables creating an observable policy constraint from a given history subset.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \input{figures/opc_scheme.tex}
    \caption{Observable policy constraint and its creation}
    \label{fig:PRAHOM_opc}
\end{figure}

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_3}$} \quad Ensuring an agent's policy generates histories belonging to a given history subset of a role.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{SS}.G_3}$} \quad Integrate constraints into an agent's policy $\pi \in \Pi$ via three modes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Correct}: Correct any chosen action $\pi(\omega)$ by an expected one in $c\pi(\omega)$. It ensures safety but is external to the agent's policy.
    \item \textbf{Penalize}: Add a penalty to the reward if a wrong action ($\pi(\omega) \notin c\pi(\omega)$) is made, encouraging agents to learn their constraints but without safety guarantees.
    \item \textbf{Correct\_Policy}: Create a constrained policy $\pi_c \in \Pi, \pi_c = bld_{\pi c}(\pi, c\pi)$, where $c\pi$ corrects the current policy $\pi$. This ensures safety internally.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Functional specifications and constraining joint-policies according to missions}

\textbf{Functional Specifications (FS)} describe the tasks and goals and are denoted as $\mathcal{FS} = \langle \mathcal{SCH}, \mathcal{PO} \rangle$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{SCH} = \langle \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{P}, mo, nm \rangle$: The set of social schemes, where:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $\mathcal{G}$: The set of global goals.
              \item $\mathcal{M}$: The set of mission labels.
              \item $\mathcal{P} = \langle \mathcal{G}, \{\mathcal{G}\}^s, OP, [0,1] \rangle$: The set of plans $(g_f, \{g_i\}_{0 \leq i \leq s}, op, ps)$.
              \item $mo: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{G})$: The goals associated with each mission.
              \item $nm: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$: The cardinality of agents committed to each mission.
          \end{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{PO}: \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{M}$: The set of preference orders $(m_1 \prec m_2)$.
\end{itemize}

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{FS}.G_1}$} \quad Representing a goal by a reward function in MARL and updating the joint reward function when an agent is committed to a mission.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{FS}.G_1}$} \quad Map a goal to a history subset using $gh: \mathcal{G} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(H)$. Thus, $mh: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(H) = \{(m,\bigcup gh[mo(m)]), m \in \mathcal{M}\}$ gives expected histories from missions.

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{FS}.G_2}$} \quad Represent a goal in MARL formalism to entice agents to achieve it.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{FS}.G_2}$} \quad Represent a goal $g \in \mathcal{G}$ by introducing an observable reward function $R_{g}: H \rightarrow \mathbb{R} = bld_{grf}(H_g)$. The relation $dist: H \times H \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ indicates how close a generated history is to a given history subset.

A mission $m \in \mathcal{M}$ containing goals $\mathcal{G}_{m} = mo(m)$ is represented as $R_m: H \rightarrow \mathbb{R} = comb_{grf}(\{bld_{grf}(H_g), g \in G\})$. The relation $comb_{grf}: \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{R}_{\mathcal{G}_{m}}) \rightarrow R_{\mathcal{M}}$ combines all observable reward functions of each goal into a single reward function for a mission.

\subsection{Deontic specification and constraining joint-policies according to permissions/obligations}

\textbf{Deontic Specifications (DS)} define the permissions and obligations and are denoted as $\mathcal{DS} = \langle \mathcal{OBL}, \mathcal{PER} \rangle$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{TC}$: The set of time constraints.
    \item $\mathcal{OBL}: \mathcal{R} \times \mathcal{M} \times \mathcal{TC}$: The set of obligations $(obl(\rho_a, m, tc))$.
    \item $\mathcal{PER}$: The set of permissions $(per(\rho_a, m, tc))$.
\end{itemize}

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{DS}.G_1}$} \quad Integrate time constraints within the training process using previous workarounds in $(\mathbf{F_{SS}})$ and $(\mathbf{F_{FS}})$.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{DS}.G_1}$} \quad Introduce the relation $da: \mathcal{PER} \cup \mathcal{OBL} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{A})$ indicating how agents are constrained to roles and committed to missions for a given time constraint. Time-to-live for each permission/obligation is introduced via $dttl: \mathcal{PER} \cup \mathcal{OBL} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ and decreased at each step. Roles and missions may change, updating the reward function and policies via $update_{R,\Pi}$.

\

\textbf{Sub-gap $\mathbf{F_{DS}.G_2}$} \quad Differentiate between obligations and permissions, ensuring agents prioritize obligated missions over permitted ones.

\textbf{Workaround $\mathbf{F_{DS}.G_2}$} \quad Use $comb_{mrf}$ as a weighted sum with high weight for obligated missions and low weight for permitted ones.


The $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ formalism offers a robust framework for defining the organization within a MAS, ensuring a clear and structured approach to specifying roles, tasks, and interactions.




\section{PRAHOM Algorithm}\label{sec:prahom_theory}

% $PRAHOM$ algorithm is presented in \autoref{alg:PRAHOM-A}. It fits within a regular MARL context: a joint-policy $\pi_{joint,ep}$ is updated after several steps allowing to have enough joint-histories $h_{joint,ep}$ and joint-rewards as feedback $r_{joint,ep}$. The training goes on over several episodes for better training until converging to a sufficient cumulative reward regarding $s$.

% $PRAHOM$ underlying idea is to represent roles and missions through permissions/obligations as history subset that agents are expected to generate while interacting.

The PRAHOM algorithm integrates organizational specifications into the learning process of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by constraining joint-policies according to predefined roles, missions, and permission/obligation relations. This method ensures that the agents' behaviors align with organizational requirements while optimizing joint-policy ($\pi_{joint,i,s}$) as output.

\textbf{Initialization and Input Parameters}: \quad
The algorithm starts by initializing the joint-policy ($\pi_{joint}$) with the initial joint-policy ($\pi_{joint,i,init}$) and setting the episode counter ($ep$) to zero (lines 1). The algorithm also sets a boolean variable ($sufficient$) to False, indicating that the cumulative reward expectancy has not yet been met.

\textbf{Step 1: Determine Joint Observable Policy Constraints}: \quad
PRAHOM determines the joint observable policy constraints ($c\pi_{joint}$) from the organizational specifications (lines 2). This step involves mapping roles and permissions/obligations to constraints on the joint-policy, ensuring that the agents' actions are in line with the organizational rules.

\textbf{Step 2: Initialize Constrained Policy}: \quad
If the mode of constraint integration is set to \textit{correct\_policy}, the algorithm creates and uses a joint constrained policy via $bld_{joint, \pi_c}$ based on the initial policy and the observable policy constraints ($c\pi_{joint}$) (line 4). This ensures that the initial policy is inherently aligned with the specified constraints from the beginning.

\textbf{Step 3: Determine Observable Reward Functions}: \quad
Next, PRAHOM determines the observable reward functions $R_{m,joint}$ from the organizational specifications (line 5). This involves mapping missions and goals to reward functions, which will guide the agents towards achieving organizational sub-goals.

\textbf{Step 4: Main Training Loop}: \quad
The main training loop runs for a maximum number of episodes ($ep_{max}$) or until the cumulative reward expectancy is met (line 6).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initialize Episode}:
          At the beginning of each episode, the environment, observation, and action histories are reinitialized (line 7). The cumulative reward and penalty are also reset. Time-to-live values for permissions/obligations are initialized using $bld_{dttl}$, and the initial observation and action are set by the environment ($d_{ep}.init()$).

    \item \textbf{Step Through Episode}:
          The algorithm steps through each episode for a maximum number of steps ($step_{max}$) (line 8). Within each step:

          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Policy Update}:
                    The joint-policy ($\pi_{joint}$) is updated using the MARL algorithm ($u_{marl}$) based on the current history and rewards (line 9).

              \item \textbf{Action Selection}:
                    The next action is selected based on the current observation ($\pi_{joint}(\omega_{joint,t=step})$) (line 10).

              \item \textbf{Action Validation}:
                    The expected actions are determined from the observable policy constraints ($c\pi_{joint}$), and if the selected action is not among the expected ones, it is either corrected or penalized based on the mode of constraint integration (lines 11-16).

              \item \textbf{Update Histories and Rewards}:
                    The current history is updated (line 17), and the action is applied to the environment to get the next observation and reward (line 18) adding any incurred penalties (line 19).

              \item \textbf{Update Constraints and Rewards}:
                    Time-to-live values are decreased, and the reward functions and policies are updated accordingly (line 20).
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Check for Sufficiency}:
          After each episode, the algorithm checks whether the cumulative reward meets the expectancy ($is\_sufficient$) and increments the episode counter ($ep$) (line 21).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Complexity and Scalability}: \quad The computational complexity of PRAHOM primarily depends on the number of episodes ($ep_{max}$), the number of steps per episode ($step_{max}$), and the complexity of the MARL algorithm ($u_{marl}$). Each step involves updating the policy, selecting \& validating actions, and updating histories and rewards, which can be computationally intensive. The memory complexity depends on the need to store rewards, policies, and histories. The history graphs we introduced allow histories to be merged compactly, reducing redundancy with limited impact on read cost.

Scalability can be challenging as the number of agents, roles, missions increases. Evaluating PRAHOM scalability requires to consider an implemented version through these salient features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} Performance for updating/validating policies strongly depends on chosen MARL algorithms capabilities such as parallelization significantly improves it (especially in Policy Optimization algorithms);
    \item \textbf{Efficient Data Structures:} The choice of data structures for storing and accessing histories or policies is crucial for reducing overhead.;
    \item \textbf{Optimization of Reward Functions:} The logic for constructing/handling reward functions is important to enhance performance further.
\end{itemize}



\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:experimental_setup}

\subsection{Algorithm implementation: PRAHOM Wrapper}

We developed the \textit{PRAHOM Wrapper}
%
\footnote{Additional information are provided in addition to the code in \url{https://github.com/julien6/omarl_experiments}.}
%
as a proof-of-concept (PoC) tool to augment PettingZoo environments, facilitating the application of the PRAHOM algorithm. This wrapper includes additional class methods to implement PRAHOM's functionalities, streamlining the training process. The wrapper leverages the MARLlib~\cite{hu2022marllib} library, which offers a comprehensive range of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and finely-tuned models.

\textbf{History Subsets} \quad We implemented a \textit{history\_subset} class to handle history subsets based on predefined patterns or rules via an implemented history graph when dealing with patterns. Alternatively, custom functions can be employed to instantiate a history\_subset, allowing more flexibility.

\textbf{Organizational Specifications to Relations} \quad The \textit{osr} class models a complete $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model that includes roles, goals, and missions, which are directly mapped to \textit{history\_subset} objects initialized with expected patterns. This mapping implements \textit{rh}, \textit{gh}, and \textit{mh}. Permissions/obligations are also defined in the \textit{osr}, mapping the agents constrained to roles and committed to missions with time constraints, thus implementing the \textit{da} relation.

\textbf{Observation Labeling (ol)} \quad The observation labeling is managed by the singleton \textit{ol\_mngr} class, which uses a regular dictionary to map observations to labels. It leverages the HuggingFace transformer model \textit{tiiuae/falcon-7b} to learn the mappings alongside the dictionary. The \textit{ol\_mngr} class includes an interactive process for users to label each displayed observation during the labeling process. %Post-training, the LLM can be employed to identify desired observations based on keywords, enhancing usability.

\textbf{History Graph} \quad We constructed the \textit{history graph} class from scratch following the theoretical foundation of ordinal numbers and cardinalities. The class provides functions to add histories or history patterns and to check whether a given history matches the stored patterns.

\textbf{Observable Policy Constraint (opc)} \quad The \textit{opc} class links pairs of (history\_pattern, observation) to lists of actions. Each association is integrated into a unified history graph object, ensuring consistency in policy constraints.

\textbf{Constrained Policy (cons\_policy)} \quad The \textit{cons\_policy} class combines a regular MARLlib policy with an \textit{opc} object. The integration involves embedding policy constraints within the MARLlib policy framework, allowing the constrained policy to respect predefined action constraints.

\textbf{Observable Reward Function (orf)} \quad The \textit{orf} class constructs an observable reward functions based on history patterns. It includes a function that evaluates whether a given history matches the initial pattern: high rewards for matching patterns, low rewards otherwise.

\textbf{Time-to-Live (dttl)} \quad The \textit{dttl} class is built using a Python dictionary that replicates data from the \textit{osr} object. This class manages the time constraints to update the observable reward function and policy constraints.

Once the PettingZoo environment is wrapped with the PRAHOM Wrapper, a function is provided to execute the PRAHOM algorithm. This function accepts a JSON object containing MARLlib details, such as the chosen MARL algorithm (e.g., MADDPG or MAPPO). It processes all defined elements, retrieves roles and missions, converts them into \textit{opc} or \textit{orf} objects and so on. Ultimately outputs a dictionary mapping each agent to its trained policy.


\subsection{AICA and MASCARA Architecture}

The \textbf{Autonomous Intelligent Cyberdefense Agent (AICA)} is an advanced system designed to autonomously protect computer networks and systems from cyber threats. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI), AICA is capable of detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats in real-time, thus reducing the need for constant human intervention. The primary components of AICA include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sensing}: Collecting data from the environment to detect potential threats.
    \item \textbf{Situation Awareness}: Understanding the current state of the network or system based on the sensed data.
    \item \textbf{Planning and Decision Making}: Formulating strategies to mitigate identified threats.
    \item \textbf{Action Execution}: Implementing the chosen actions to defend against or neutralize threats.
    \item \textbf{Learning}: Continuously improving by learning from previous incidents and outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{MASCARA} (MAS-Centric AICA Reference Architecture) is a conceptual framework developed to enhance the capabilities of AICAs by leveraging the principles of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). In a MASCARA-based system, multiple intelligent agents work collaboratively to provide a robust and adaptive cyber defense. The key features of MASCARA include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modularity}: The system consists of various independent agents, each with specific roles and capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Collaboration}: Agents communicate and collaborate to achieve common goals, such as identifying and mitigating threats.
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: The architecture can easily be scaled by adding more agents to handle increased workloads or new types of threats.
    \item \textbf{Flexibility}: Agents can be updated or replaced without disrupting the entire system, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation.
    \item \textbf{Resilience}: The distributed nature of the system ensures that it can continue to function even if some agents are compromised or fail.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MASCARA into $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$}

The MASCARA architecture can be understood through the lens of the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ framework, which provides a structured approach to organizing multi-agent systems.

\subsubsection*{Structural Specification}

In the MASCARA architecture, the organization is divided into distinct roles, groups, and their interrelationships. The key roles include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SensorAgent}: These agents are responsible for continuously collecting data from various sources, monitoring network activities, and identifying potential threats.
    \item \textbf{AnalysisAgent}: These agents analyze the collected data to understand the situation, detect anomalies, and recognize attack patterns.
    \item \textbf{DecisionAgent}: Once a threat is identified, these agents formulate strategies to mitigate the identified threats by deciding the best course of action.
    \item \textbf{ExecutionAgent}: These agents implement the chosen actions to neutralize the threats, ensuring that the response is carried out effectively.
    \item \textbf{LearningAgent}: These agents focus on learning from past incidents and outcomes, updating their knowledge base, and improving the overall system's performance.
\end{itemize}

Each of these roles is grouped into specific teams that collaborate to achieve the overall goals of the MASCARA architecture.

\subsubsection*{Functional Specification}

The functional aspect of MASCARA involves defining the missions and goals that each role aims to accomplish. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection Mission}: This mission is assigned to SensorAgents to ensure continuous monitoring and data gathering.
    \item \textbf{Threat Analysis Mission}: AnalysisAgents are tasked with analyzing data in real-time to detect potential threats.
    \item \textbf{Strategy Formulation Mission}: DecisionAgents work on developing strategies quickly upon the identification of threats.
    \item \textbf{Threat Mitigation Mission}: ExecutionAgents are responsible for carrying out the mitigation strategies immediately.
    \item \textbf{Learning Mission}: LearningAgents update and refine the system based on new data and outcomes post-incident.
\end{itemize}

The primary goals are to collect data, analyze threats, formulate effective strategies, execute mitigation actions, and learn from incidents to adapt and improve.

\subsubsection*{Deontic Specification}

The deontic specifications of the MASCARA architecture define the permissions and obligations of each role in the form of 3-tuples (role, mission, time\_constraint).

\paragraph*{Obligations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item SensorAgents are obligated to continuously monitor and report data.
    \item AnalysisAgents must perform real-time threat analysis.
    \item DecisionAgents are required to devise strategies within a short timeframe.
    \item ExecutionAgents need to execute actions immediately as per strategy.
    \item LearningAgents are obligated to update the system based on new information after each incident.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Permissions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item SensorAgents are permitted to access multiple data sources as needed.
    \item AnalysisAgents can use historical data for analysis on demand.
    \item DecisionAgents are allowed to consult with other DecisionAgents collaboratively.
    \item ExecutionAgents can request additional resources as necessary.
    \item LearningAgents are permitted to update AI models as needed.
\end{itemize}

These specifications ensure that each agent knows its responsibilities and the extent of its authority, facilitating a well-coordinated and efficient cyber defense operation.



\subsection{CybORG CAGE Challenge 3 Environment}

We selected the CybORG CAGE Challenge 3 environment, which simulates a swarm of autonomous drones operating in a complex cyber-infrastructure. The environment includes multiple drones (\texttt{drone\_0}, \texttt{drone\_1}, \ldots, \texttt{drone\_n}), each with specific capabilities and roles within the swarm. The goal is to secure critical assets and protect against cyber-attacks.

\textbf{Environment Details:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Agents:} Multiple autonomous drones with varying capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Actions:} Drone maneuvers, cyber-attacks, defensive actions.
    \item \textbf{Observation and State Shapes:} Diverse sensor data and cyber-threat indicators.
    \item \textbf{Rewards:} Points for securing assets, preventing attacks, and neutralizing threats.
\end{itemize}

We utilized the MAPPO and MADDPG algorithms from MARLlib tailored for cooperative behavior among autonomous agents.

\subsection{Organizational Models}

We implemented and evaluated four organizational models tailored for the CybORG CAGE Challenge 3 environment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Suspect Isolation Model:} Identifies and isolates drones exhibiting suspicious cyber-activities.
    \item \textbf{Cyberdefense Model 1:} Coordinates defensive actions against incoming cyber-attacks.
    \item \textbf{Cyberdefense Model 2:} Implements proactive measures to detect and mitigate potential threats.
    \item \textbf{Manual Control Model:} A baseline model with manually defined roles and actions for drones.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Procedure}

We trained each organizational model using the PRAHOM Wrapper within the CybORG CAGE Challenge 3 environment. The wrapper integrates organizational specifications and constraints into the MARLlib policies, enabling agents to learn and adapt their behavior based on predefined roles and missions.

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}

Our evaluation criteria include both qualitative and quantitative assessments:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $(\mathbf{C1.1})$: Qualitative assessment involves observing the adoption of specific roles and strategies by drones, such as isolating suspicious activities or coordinating defensive maneuvers.
    \item $(\mathbf{C2.1})$: Quantitative metrics measure the convergence time and average rewards obtained by each model, indicating the effectiveness of organizational constraints.
    \item $(\mathbf{C3.1})$: Comparative analysis between models to determine which organizational structure best enhances collective cyber-defense capabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discussion}

\textbf{Qualitative Observations}:
The organizational models effectively influenced drone behavior in the CybORG CAGE Challenge 3 environment. The Suspect Isolation Model demonstrated effective identification and isolation of drones exhibiting suspicious activities, enhancing overall security.

\textbf{Quantitative Analysis}:
Cyberdefense Model 2 showed the fastest convergence and highest average reward, indicating its effectiveness in proactive threat mitigation. This model significantly outperformed the Manual Control Model, highlighting the benefits of automated organizational frameworks in dynamic cyber-defense scenarios.

The experimental results confirm the importance of organizational models in enhancing coordination and effectiveness among autonomous agents in complex cyber-physical environments like CybORG CAGE Challenge 3. Future research could explore further refinements and adaptations of organizational specifications to optimize collective behaviors and response capabilities.

% Multi-agent methods rely on the designer's knowledge to design a suitable MAS organization, but do not provide automatic means to determine the relevant organizational mechanisms only from the design requirements and the overall objective.
% MARL techniques have been successfully applied to automatically train agents to achieve a given objective without explicit characterization of emerging collective strategies.
% The PRAHOM's originality is to enrich a MARL process with an explicit organizational model towards a methodological objective to address these issues. It links the agents' policies (modeled in a Dec-POMDP) with $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ through the process PRAHOM. Under the simplifying conditions of a group and a single social pattern, PRAHOM makes it possible to partially determine organizational specifications from joint histories and to constrain the training of policies in relation to organizational specifications.
% Additionally, we implemented the \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo} wrapper as a proof of concept to apply PRAHOM.
% Finally, we applied our approach in four \emph{PettingZoo} environments to evaluate the impact during and after training. The performances obtained appear to be comparable to those known.

% Key point summary

\section{Conclusion}

Our main contribution is the PRAHOM algorithmic approach that aims to link MARL and agents' policies with the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ model leveraging on relations between joint-histories and organizational specifications. It seeks to constrain the agents' training according to expected behaviors expressed as organizational specifications.

As a first implementation, \emph{PRAHOM Wrapper} is assessed in a cooperative Atari game, where the inferred organizational specifications generally match the expected hand-crafted results. Despite the implementation's limited functionalities, the initial results showed that the PRAHOM approach can constrain the resulting agents' policy space according to the specified organizational constraints. Additionally, we manually verified that some valuable organizational specifications are inferred from trained agents' histories.

Even though PRAHOM is agnostic of any MARL algorithm, directing the collective behaviors of agents a priori can prove difficult. Major perspectives to improve PRAHOM are inspired by hierarchical learning, which contributes to better emergence of strategies during learning.

Furthermore, while the initial results obtained with \emph{LLM} show it as a promising complementary tool for PRAHOM, it may also illuminate new avenues for explaining collective behavior beyond its intended use.

% Ultimately, we also aim to improve the applicability of PRAHOM by developing dedicated interfaces built around PRAHOM making it more accessible to industrial and research contexts.
