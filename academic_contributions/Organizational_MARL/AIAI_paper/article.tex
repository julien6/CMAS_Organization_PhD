\section{Introduction}

% Context:

% TODO: expliquer pourquoi les SMA sont pertinents grâce à leur décomposition de l'objectif (autonomie, délègue, coopération, auto-organisation)
Multi-agent systems (MAS) have gained significant interest in engineering and industry due to their ability to address complex, distributed problems. They provide ways to handle conflicting goals, parallel computation, system robustness, and scalability. The applications of MAS are diverse, including autonomous driving, multi-robot factories~\cite{Oliveira1999, Gembarski2020}. % TODO: réseau VANET, collective robotics
In MAS, organization is a fundamental concept that impact how agents coordinate their activities to collaboratively achieve a common goal~\cite{Hubner2002}.
%The design and implementation of a MAS are significantly impacted by the organization.
Organizational aspects are crucial for addressing the challenge of MAS design in dynamic and uncertain environments, where runtime behavior needs to be flexible~\cite{Kathleen2020}. The impact organization on MAS design is core in methodologies and frameworks that enable the engineering of application-specific MAS~\cite{Noel2010}. % TODO: trouver une ref plus récente

% In essence, we assume the entity of the organization (we simply call \textbf{organization}) always exists through the running agents interactions even though it may be implicit. An \textbf{organizational model} specifies (at least partially) the organization whether it is used as medium to describe an explicit known organization in a top-down way, or describing an implicit organization in a bottom-up way. Examples of organizational models are the Agent/Group/Role (AGR) model~\cite{Ferber2004} or more complex ones such as $\mathcal{M}OISE^{+}$~\cite{Hubner2002}. Organizational models can take into account aspects such as structural coordination, dynamic interactions, and the achievement of common objectives~\cite{Ferber2004, Abbas2015}. We call the \textbf{specifications} of an organization, the set of components used in an instance of an organizational model to specify the organization.

% TODO: ACPV/OCPV mal introduit
MAS designing/development methods, have been proposed jointly with organizational models to help designers finding suited specifications of an organization so that a MAS can reach a goal efficiently in a environment. Methods such as GAIA~\cite{Wooldridge2000}, ADELFE~\cite{Bernon2003} or DIAMOND~\cite{Jamont2005} lead to develop \textbf{self/re-organization} mechanisms from agents' rules (we call \textbf{policies}) enabling the MAS to adapt on the deployment environment.
These agents' policies are defined by the designer from Agent Centered Point of View (ACPV) or
% TODO: 
Organization Centered Point of View (OCPV) so that an optional emerging/chosen organization allows reaching a global goal~\cite{Picard2009}. It often takes place as an iterative process where designers are proceeding by trial and error. Despite the designer skills, that process may be hard and costly to converge towards a sufficiently estimated successful MAS. That process gets more difficult when the target deployment environment is not easily readable or handleable due to the complexity and internal safety policies such as for company infrastructure networks. Additionally, unexpected emergent phenomena may appear without giving guarantees for safety.
% TODO: mieux introduire l'exemple de l'environnement réseau pour les SMAC
As a notable environment, computers network with highly complex and non-visual interactions and the lack of intuitive comprehension of the environment can make MAS methods difficult to apply to develop a MAS that aims to ensure Cyberdefense by tackling the impact of malware programs.

% We assume an organization in a MAS can be understood regarding the Agent Centered Point of View (ACPV) vs. Organization Centered Point of View (OCPV) and agent's organization awareness vs. unawareness~\cite{Picard2009}.
% Typical examples are emergent MAS (ACPV and organization unawareness), coalition based MAS (ACPV and organization awareness), organization based MAS (OCPV and organization awareness), and Agent oriented engineering (OCPV and organization unawareness)~\cite{Picard2009}.
% We assume an \textbf{architecture} (also called organizational paradigm) is an abstract organization gathering a range of organizations sharing common characteristics~\cite{Horling2004}.

% Problem:

Instead of adopting a risky direct empiric approach, a common approach is to rely on a intermediary step by simulating the target deployment system, analogous to \textquote{digital twins}. Indeed, simulation can provide a monitoring framework that leaves room for a safe design process, while having an assessment of the resulting MAS designs. If the simulation is close enough to the target system in terms of fidelity, then we can expect the designed MAS to be transferred to the target system for indeed reaching the goals.
% TODO: "goal" peut-être pas clair
In that respect, creating a MAS that aims to reach a goal in any given environment, firstly focuses on finding a suited MAS design only in the associated simulation.
% TODO: introduire la contribution nouvelle en rebondissant sur le début de l'introduction
% expliquer: ingénierie de SMA -> organisation -> pourquoi c'est assisté ? (expliquer le titre)
We also, hypothesized the simulation to enable various collective AI techniques and to give, at least, raw description of the current environment and agents states.

Considering that context, there is no systematic available methodological approach to be used both at research and engineering levels that enables benefitting from the observation of emergent collective strategies in simulation for MAS designing.
% It is particularly import to address...
We must particularly address the need for automating the design process as much as possible while keeping the designer in the loop to ensure the resulting MAS is understandable and safe.

% Contribution

% TODO: montrer la contribution -> fournir un outil supplémentaire à un ingénieur pour concevoir un SMA à partir de MARL + modèle organisationel
% Mettre en valeur les points forts (enlever les Dec-POMDP) -> être plus général

We propose AMOEA, a novel MAS design approach whose core uses a combination of MARL through Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) and the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model to generate suited agent's policies with respect to given specifications; and automatically generating the associated understandable organizational specifications. After having generated relevant OCPV specifications based on the environment, the initial design constraints, and goals; the approach consists in assisting the development of a safely built MAS in light of these specifications to better matches requirements and goals.

% Results

We applied AOMEA in three spatial Atari games with various degree of cooperation among agents to achieve a goal the best while optionally respecting organizational specifications as design constraints. Obtained organization specifications are exploitable, coherent with expectations, and respect design constraints. We also applied our approach, in a Cyberdefense drone swarm environment whose resulting organizational specifications led to develop a MAS with scores comparable to the leading ones.

The remainder of the article is built as following.
In section II, while introducing the premises for the core of our approach, we expose related works we identified to those.
In section III, we present AOMEA that relies on Dec-POMDP and $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ to help designers in designing a suited organization in their own MAS regarding environment, design constraints, and goals.
In section IV, we discuss results obtained after applying our approach in the cooperative Atari games and the Cyberdefense environment.
In section V, we conclude on the viability and relevance of our approach as we highlight limitations to overcome and future works as well.

\section{Theoretical background}

% TODO: "related works" à mettre à la fin 



As suggested, one can think of benefitting of a MARL process that would automatically converge to an optimal or sub-optimally sufficient solution as for establishing the rules in agents (called \textbf{policies}) that drive the MAS to the goal. Yet, unlike human-based design where the agent's logic is explicitly specified, trained policies with MARL may be approximated by black box generalizing functions such as Neural Networks. That stresses out the need to address the explainability issue not only for individual agents' policies but for the joint-policy in its entirety through OCPV.

We think, this problem can be partially addressed by considering that a joint-policy can be (at least partially) described in terms of the organizational specifications.
We refer to research in the processes falling into that broad approach under the term of \textquote{Organization oriented MARL} (OMARL).
In that context, we propose the \emph{Partial Relations with Agent History and Organization Model} (PRAHOM) process to link agents' policies and their training to an organizational model.

The chosen MARL model is based on the Decentralized Dec-POMDP~\cite{Oliehoek2016} because it considers multiple agents in a similar MAS fashion. It relies on stochastic processes to model uncertainty of the environment for the changes induced by actions, in received observations, in communication\dots Additionally, unlike Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSG), the reward function can be common to agents which fosters training for collaborative oriented actions~\cite{Beynier2013}. Formally, a Dec-POMDP is a 7-tuple $(S,\{A_i\},T,R,\{\Omega_i\},O,\gamma)$ , where: $S = \{s_1, ..s_{|S|}\}$: The set of the possible states; $A_{i} = \{a_{1}^{i},..,a_{|A_{i}|}^{i}\}$: The set of the possible actions for agent $i$; $T$ so that $T(s,a,s') = \probP{(s'|s,a)}$ : The set of conditional transition probabilities between states; $R: S \times A \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$: The reward function; $\Omega_{i} = \{o_{1}^{i},..,o_{|\Omega_{i}|}^{i}\}$: The set of observations for agent $ag_i$; $O$ so that $O(s',a,o) = \probP{(o|s',a)}$ : The set of conditional observation probabilities; $\gamma \in [0,1]$, the discount factor.

Among, the existing organizational models \textquote{Agent/Group/Role}~\cite{Ferber2004} and \allowbreak $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$~\cite{Hubner2002} both provide a relevant high-level description of the structures and interactions within the MAS. However, we favor $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ because it provides an advanced formal description for an organization without incompatibilities with MARL, especially for formal description of agents' policies. It takes into account explicitly the social aspects between agents where \textquote{AGR} focuses on the integration of standards oriented towards design. Additionally, it provides a sufficiently detailed vision of organization to be understood at different point of views. $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ comprises: Structural specifications mainly related to roles, their links, compatibilities\dots; Functional specifications mainly related to goals, their repartition in missions and plans\dots; Deontic Specifications as the permission and obligations for a agent playing a role to commit to a mission~\cite{Hubner2002}.



% ====
Developing a Multi-Agent System (MAS) involves various engineering methods and methodologies that are designed to address the complexities inherent in the design, implementation, and deployment of such systems. These methods are essential for ensuring that MAS can effectively coordinate, communicate, and execute tasks in a distributed and often dynamic environment. Below, we explore some of the key assisted engineering methods and methodologies for developing MAS.

\paragraph{\textbf{Method Fragments and Model Transformations}}
A set of method fragments for developing MAS, which is grounded on the development process of two multi-agent systems, emphasizes the importance of model transformations in the engineering process~\cite{Garcia2011}. These fragments can be seen as modular methodologies that can be adapted and reused across different MAS projects, providing a flexible approach to system development.

\paragraph{\textbf{Meta-Models for Analysis and Design}}
The use of meta-models is reported to improve analysis and design activities in MAS engineering~\cite{Gomez2004}. Meta-models provide a high-level abstraction that can help in understanding and designing the complex interactions and behaviors of agents within the system, facilitating a more structured approach to MAS development.

\paragraph{\textbf{Agent-Oriented Software Engineering Paradigms}}

Agent technology represents a new software engineering paradigm that offers fresh prospects for analyzing, designing, and building software systems~\cite{Li2016}. This paradigm shift towards agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) encourages developers to think in terms of autonomous agents and their interactions, leading to more robust and adaptable MAS.

\paragraph{\textbf{Comprehensive Methodologies}}

Several comprehensive methodologies have been proposed for MAS development, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Tropos}: An agent-oriented software development methodology that emphasizes early requirements analysis and the continuous refinement of these requirements through the design and implementation phases~\cite{Bresciani2004}.
    \item \emph{Gaia}: A methodology for the analysis and design of MAS, focusing on the organizational structure of the system~\cite{Zambonelli2003}.
    \item \emph{INGENIAS}: A methodology that provides a suite of tools and a formal framework for the development of MAS~\cite{Pavon2003}.
    \item \emph{MaSE (Multi-agent Systems Engineering)}: A methodology that guides the analysis and design of MAS from initial system goals to the detailed agent design~\cite{Scott2004}.
\end{itemize}

Yet, these methodological works significantly rely on human designers while none of them enable automating the assistance of the MAS design process by guaranteeing sufficient efficiency while taking into account organizational aspects in a multiagent context.
Willing to fill that gap with AOMEA, we also included works dealing with to the links between organizational specifications and the emergence of collective phenomena through MARL or MAS algorithms on various environments.
Among the works we considered, we present most notable ones below dispatched among those related to the expression of MARL through OCPV and those related to the adaptation of the MARL process itself to meet specific design constraints.

\paragraph{\textbf{Frameworks for MARL with organizational aspects}}

% MARLeME: A MARL Model Extraction Library
Kazhdan et. al.~\cite{Kazhdan2020} introduces MARLeME, a library designed to enhance the explainability of MARL systems by approximating them with symbolic models. The library aims to improve the interpretability of MARL systems, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of multiple agents interacting in a shared environment. By providing a means to extract symbolic models from MARL systems, MARLeME contributes to the advancement of explainable AI in the context of multi-agent systems.
%
% ROMA: MARL with Emergent Roles
Wang et. al.~\cite{Wang2020} introduces a role-oriented MARL approach where roles are emergent, and agents with similar roles tend to share their learning and specialize in certain sub-tasks. The framework aims to combine the flexibility and adaptability of MARL with the concept of roles, allowing agents with similar roles to exhibit similar behaviors. The approach is designed to learn specialized, dynamic, and identifiable roles without relying on predefined role structures and behaviors. The research provides a novel perspective on the application of role-oriented MARL in complex multi-agent systems, offering potential advancements in the field of reinforcement learning.
%
% A unified framework for reinforcement learning, co-learning and meta-learning how to coordinate in collaborative multi-agent systems
Tosic et. al~\cite{Tosic2010} presents a comprehensive framework for addressing coordination in collaborative multi-agent systems. The framework integrates reinforcement learning, co-learning, and meta-learning to enable agents to learn how to coordinate effectively. By leveraging this unified approach, the paper aims to enhance the coordination and communication capabilities of multi-agent systems, ultimately improving their overall performance.
%
% Magent: A many-agent reinforcement learning platform for artificial collective intelligence
Zheng et. al.~\cite{Zheng2018} presents MAgent, a platform for MARL that aims to facilitate research on artificial collective intelligence. MAgent provides a flexible and efficient environment for training and evaluating MARL algorithms, enabling the study of complex multi-agent behaviors. The platform supports various scenarios, including cooperative, competitive, and mixed environments, and offers a high degree of scalability to accommodate a large number of agents. MAgent also includes a comprehensive set of baselines and evaluation metrics to benchmark the performance of MARL algorithms. The research contributes to the advancement of collective intelligence and the development of robust multi-agent systems.

% \paragraph{\textbf{Characterization of emergent collective strategies}}

% % Collective explainable AI: Explaining cooperative strategies and agent contribution in multiagent reinforcement learning with shapley values
% Heuillet et. al.~\cite{Heuillet2022} proposes a novel approach to explain cooperative strategies in multiagent reinforcement learning (RL) using Shapley values, a game theory concept used in eXplainable AI (XAI). The study aims to make deep RL more comprehensible and address the need for methods that provide better understanding and interpretability. The experimental results on Multiagent Particle and Sequential Social Dilemmas demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley values in explaining the rationale behind decisions taken by agents. However, the article also highlights that Shapley values can only provide general explanations about a model and cannot explain specific actions taken by agents. The authors suggest that future work should focus on addressing these limitations. The study's implications extend to areas such as non-discriminatory decision making, ethical and responsible AI-derived decisions, and policy making under fairness constraints.

% % Social Influence as Intrinsic Motivation for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
% Jaques et. al.~\cite{Jaques2019} proposes a mechanism for achieving coordination and communication in MARL by rewarding agents for having causal influence over other agents' actions. This causal influence is assessed using counterfactual reasoning, where agents simulate alternate actions to compute their effect on the behavior of other agents. The paper demonstrates that this approach leads to enhanced coordination and communication, as well as more meaningful learned communication protocols. The proposed method is shown to significantly increase the learning curves of the deep reinforcement learning agents, leading to more diversified team behavior and more successful performance of the population as a whole. The paper also highlights that the influence rewards for all agents can be computed in a decentralized way, opening up new opportunities for research in this area.

\paragraph{\textbf{Adaptation of MARL to meet requirements}}

% Efficient MARL through automated supervision
Chongjie et. al.~\cite{Chongjie2008} proposes a unified mechanism for achieving coordination and communication in MARL. The approach involves training multiple agents to independently maximize their own individual reward without sharing weights. The paper introduces a method for automated supervision, which enables the agents to learn to coordinate and communicate effectively. This automated supervision mechanism leads to enhanced coordination, communication, and more meaningful learned communication protocols, ultimately improving the learning curves of the deep reinforcement learning agents and the overall performance of the agent population
%
% Self-Organized Group for Cooperative MARL
Shao et. al.~\cite{Shao2022} introduces a method called Self-Organized Group (SOG) for cooperative MARL. In this approach, a certain number of agents are randomly elected to be conductors, and the corresponding groups are constructed with conductor-follower consensus, allowing the groups to be re-organized at regular intervals. The organized group under the unified command of a conductor is found to embed the multi-agent system with stronger zero-shot generalization ability compared to traditional methods. The SOG method provides strong adaptability to scenarios with varying numbers of agents and varying agent sight. The paper presents this approach as a mechanism to enhance cooperative multi-agent tasks with dynamic characteristics, aiming to improve the adaptability and generalization of MARL systems
%
% % A MARL model of common-pool resource appropriation
% Perolat et. al.~\cite{Perolat2017} introduces a model that focuses on common-pool resource appropriation, a multi-agent social dilemma that includes issues such as sustainable use of fresh water, common fisheries, grazing pastures, and irrigation systems. The model emphasizes the importance of trial-and-error learning in addressing the challenges of common-pool resource sustainability and inequality. It explores the emergent behavior of groups of independently learning agents in a partially observed Markov game, shedding light on the relationship between exclusion, cooperation, and sustainability in the context of resource appropriation. The research highlights the potential of deep reinforcement learning in understanding and addressing complex societal and environmental challenges related to common-pool resource management. The paper provides valuable insights into the application of MARL in the context of real-world social dilemmas and resource management
%
% Promoting Coordination through Policy Regularization in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
Roy et. al.~\cite{Roy2020} addresses the challenge of inducing coordination between agents in MARL. The research investigates the use of policy regularization to promote inter-agent coordination and discusses two approaches based on inter-agent modeling and synchronized sub-policy selection. The proposed methods are designed to improve cooperative behaviors without relying on explicit communication channels, allowing agents to exhibit coordinated behaviors during testing when acting in a decentralized fashion. The paper presents two policy regularization methods, TeamReg and CoachReg, and evaluates their performance on challenging cooperative multi-agent problems, showing improved results. The research contributes to the advancement of coordination-driven multi-agent approaches in reinforcement learning and provides valuable insights into promoting inter-agent coordination through policy regularization.

Eventually, among considered works, none are specifically using an organizational model as a general way for both expressing the MARL resulting through OCPV; and constraining the MARL itself according to organizational specifications. It appears that augmenting MARL with an organizational model so it can be core of a aided-engineering MAS design approach; is not explicitly covered as far as we know.

% - Organizational oriented MARL: a general research study focusing in integrating the organization in MARL at several aspects
% - DMO (Dec-POMDP MOISE+ OMARL): a class of algorithm falling into OMARL purposes that use MOISE+ as organizational model and Dec-POMDP as a MARL model
% - PRAHOM (Partial Relations with Agent History and Organization Model): a DMO algorithm that allows both getting the organizational specifications out of trained agents; and driving their training to satisfy extra design organizational specifications as constraints.

We proposed the PRAHOM algorithm\autoref{alg:prahom} as a synthesis of two processes that fall into the OMARL purposes. The first process gets the specifications out of the agents' policies; and the second process to get the joint-policies satisfying given specifications.

Here we just present the underlying idea at a high-level description for these two processes to avoid unnecessary formalism. A full formal description and implementation can found in \cite{}.

\paragraph{\textbf{Infering OS from joint-policies}}

Rather than using directly agents' policy, we use the history as it may be built with observed resulting actions when observations are received during a series of test episodes. Indeed, for a given policy $\pi \in \Pi$ the associated history is by definition $h \in h_{joint} = ((\omega_k,a_k) | k \in \mathbb{N})$ and the $(\omega_k,a_k) \in \pi$. Taking into account several agents, joint-history can be seen as an approximation of the joint-policy that we refer to as reconstructed joint-policy $R\Pi_{joint} \subset \Pi_{joint}$. A reconstructed policy with a history is $r\pi_i = {(\omega, a) \in h | h \in H}$;

Then, due to the difficulty to infer information related to organizational specifications, we associate each action in MARL with some organization specifications as a \textquote{many to many} relation. It sets up a first frame for identifying organizational specifications in played action series. We address that problem in the remainder of this section.

We propose some relations between $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ specifications and joint-histories. Their premises comes from noticing some specifications in the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model can be obviously mapped to subsets of actions from a single sub-optimal joint-policy.
From these relation, we propose to rely on the previous relations to develop a empirical algorithm we call \emph{PRAHOM-pos} to infer organizational specifications out of joint-policies. Below we informally describe key points for understanding that process (cf. PRAHOM-Wrapper\ref{gym-wrapper} for the implementation).

As we have only one group, we do not consider the inter-links and inter-compatibilities. Additionally as a simplification, we consider only one social scheme. As a general remark, the \textquote{determine*} relations are not all fully described and rely on custom implementation (cf. \autoref{gym-wrapper} for further information).

PRAHOM-pos first look at the individual level.
First, it tries to figure out the roles, links, subgroups, individual goals, missions and plans played by agents by sampling history sub-sequences $h \in H$ and comparing with known history sub-sequences whose we know the associated role via established relations.

Then PRAHOM-pos look at the social and collective level.
At the end of each joint-policy we try to reinforce a global view of the goals, missions, plans, and the knowledge of the mission to goal; with the partially inferred information at the individual level.

At the end of the algorithm, it tries to synthesize the knowledge infered until know to have better view of the number of agent per subgroup, the agent cardinality per mission, the role cardinality, the compatibilities between roles, the permissions and obligations.


\paragraph{\textbf{Constraining joint-policies satisfying OS}}

We consider a given MARL algorithm that iteratively converges towards a joint-policy so that each agent's policy is updated at each step until a finite horizon. Indeed, constraining the available action set for each agent to the action sets authorized by the organization specifications at each step of the MARL training; implies constraining the converged joint-policies to the ones that satisfy the given organization specifications. We used that result, to setup \emph{PRAHOM-sop-training}, the process used jointly with MARL learning to satisfy organizational constraints.

\emph{PRAHOM-sop-training} first converts the $os_{init} \in OS_{init}$ design specifications into a $forbidden$ set of the non-authorized joint-policies. It uses a non-described reverse \emph{PRAHOM-pos} algorithm to achieve it.

Then, \emph{PRAHOM-sop-training} uses a given MARL algorithm to update the agents' individual policies with previous action, observation and resulting reward. Then, it first computes the authorized actions set $A_{step}$ according to the current history $h_{joint,i}$. Then, an action is chosen among authorized actions. That action $a_{step}$ is added in history to be used for updating the agent's policy in the next step.
Finally, considering only one iteration of episode, it returns a sub-optimal joint-policy $\pi_{joint}$ satisfying $os_{init}$
We can note the $os_{init}$ could forbid the MARL algorithm to provide a joint-policy that reaches a expected cumulative reward.

    \include{figures/approach}
    \caption{A summary view of our approach to MAS design}
    \label{fig:design_approach}
\end{figure}

Relying on PRAHOM, we introduce AOMEA as an approach for MAS design that automates the pre-designing of a MAS that has to respect some design constraints; while the obtained organizational specifications allow developing a curated MAS.

A major advantage of AOMEA is that it is agnostic of the approximation function used for implementing the agents' policies such as neural networks based ones. Moreover, our approach can be generally applied in any environment able to be simulated.

AOMEA first consider the environment with agents that are to achieve some goals. It automatically enables finding relevant insights under the form of organizational specifications. They are to transparently express how agents could individually act and collaborate to reach the goals. Then, the MAS design process can be assisted in light of these indications. As a high-level description AOMEA consists in:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Linking some observation and action with related known specifications such as roles, links between roles, objectives or missions\dots;
    \item Defining the training specifications as design constraints before launching a simulation of several episodes;
    \item Training agents with regular algorithms such as MADDPG or PPO within PRAHOM;
    \item Extracting organizational specifications out of the  trained agents' policies in a single episode run via PRAHOM;
    \item Understanding and curating the raw specifications to get relevant, safe and clean organizational specifications
    \item Implementing the MAS in light of the curated organizational specifications and checking its validity
\end{enumerate}

An illustrative representation of our approach is presented in Figure \ref{fig:design_approach}. The organizational model $\mathcal{M}OISE^{+}$ is related to the policies learned via the PRAHOM process. In this process, we seek to define the structural, functional and deontic specifications of $\mathcal{M}OISE^{+}$ with respect to the learned policies (1). For example, we can determine the infered agents' roles, links and compatibilities between roles, how the determined goals are organized in plans and how agents can commit to them. Conversely, the specifications of the organization constrain the space of possible agent policies (2). For example, some of the actions labeled for particular roles may or may not be accessible to an agent depending on the assigned role.

The interest is to provide at least the designer with indications on the specifications of an organization capable of satisfying the constraints of the environment and initial design. In light of these initial results, the designer can decide to propose specifications which he can ensure meet the safety and explainability requirements. These specifications then serve as a blueprint for implementing a MAS as described in Figure \ref{fig:design_approach}.

\paragraph{\textbf{PRAHOM Gym Wrapper}\label{gym-wrapper}} We developed a \textquote{Gym Wrapper} to help in automate the setting up of PRAHOM for a given Gym Environment. It enables linking actions with $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ specifications, define the training specifications and provide functions to extract the resulting sub-optimal raw organizational specifications. During training, actions are masked to force an agent to learn to act according to the organizational specifications. The wrapper is available at \url{https://github.com/julien6/omarl_experiments}.

% todo: revoir l'intro -> c'est quoi le problème ? pk le MARL ? Il faut bien expliquer la démarche du papier (x phrases pour une même section)

We selected 4 environments to assess our approach: \textquote{Predator-prey with communication}~\cite{Lowe2017} (PPY) that consists in predators monitored by a leader to better catch preys; \textquote{Pistonball} (PBL)~\cite{Terry2021} that consists in a series of piston to bring a ball from right to left side; \textquote{Knights Archers Zombies}~\cite{Terry2021} (KAZ) that consists in a few knights and archers learning how to kill as much zombies a possible; \textquote{Drone swarm - 3rd CAGE Challenge}~\cite{cage_challenge_3_announcement} (CYB) that consists in blue agents deployed in drones while trying to tackle embedded malware programs' impact.

We applied our approach in three cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No training specifications (NTS)
    \item Partially constraining training specifications (PTS)
    \item Fully constraining training specifications (FTS)
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/prahom_learning_curve.png}
    \caption{Average reward for each iteration in Pistonball environment}
    \label{fig:prahom_learning_curve}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Principal Component Analysis of the trained agent histories in Pistonball environment}
    \label{fig:prahom_pca_analysis}
\end{figure}

To evaluate the impact of our approach in training we payed attention to the following criteria: convergence time, stability, global performance, change sensibility. Results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:training_AOMEA_results}.

\input{tables/training_OMARL_results.tex}

As a general observation, we can notice convergence time is bigger for NTS than for PTS which is also bigger than for FTS. That makes sense for the search space is decreasing, hence a shorter convergence time. As an example, we noticed a way faster convergence to a sub-optimal solution in Pistonball environment by providing extra organizational specifications as presented in \autoref{fig:prahom_learning_curve}. Global performance indicated by cumulative reward show NTS to outperform PTS and FTS for agents are overfitted to solving the problem much more finely than the designer's specifications can do.

As for assessing AOMEA results, we also took into account criteria after training: roles, links, compatibilities, social schemes. Results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:trained_AOMEA_results}

\input{tables/trained_OMARL_results.tex}

% //TODO: Moise+ schemes and comparison with expected ones

For \textquote{Pistonball} we can notice roles to be equivalent which is logical for agents are expected to act the same. Indeed, trained agents' histories are close hence showing a common emerging role. In \autoref{fig:prahom_pca_analysis} we can see most agent's histories are in the left bottom zone of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We can also check no organizational specifications except roles have been generated for agents are indeed not expected to communicate. For \textquote{Knights, Archers, Zombies} we can notice two distinct roles that are indeed expected due to the agent's different capacities for knights and archers. Yet we can also a collective pattern to be drawn between archers and knights despite no communication. For \textquote{Prey, predators with Communication}, we can observe output specifications indicate authority links among two (predator leader and simple predator) of the emerging roles. That result is also expected for these links enable collective strategies to allow predators to circle a prey. Finally, the \textquote{Drone swarm - 3rd CAGE Challenge} shows communication between blue agents are indeed understood as communication links enabling to isolate infiltrated drone then trying to reimage and alert recently suspect drones.

For the \textquote{Drone swarm - 3rd CAGE Challenge} we developed our own custom MAS via a simple decision tree as preconised in AOMEA in light of the organizational specifications we curated by removing noisy results. The mean score we got about -2000 which is indeed close to the TOP 3 scores. This shows AOMEA to be indeed applicable for Cyberdefense context ultimately bringing more safety than just regular MARL trained MAS.

This article intends to address the need for easing the MAS designing when it can not be easily conducted by human designers due to the high complexity, low readability, highly changing and uncertainity of some environments. Our premise is to link good results obtained with MARL with some organizational model in order to get a human-readable idea of some suited organization in MAS to guide a safe monitored MAS design. Literature shows works have been provided focusing on emergent collective strategies using RL techniques or providing algorithms to make them emerge. Yet, we were unable to connect our idea with identified works as for using both MARL and an organizational model towards a MAS design approach. First, we formalized our idea for linking MARL with organizational model through Dec-POMDP and $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$. Relying on that formalism, we exposed the approach for MAS design using the link between MARL and organizational model. It resulted into a "Gym wrapper" for constraining agents' training according to their training organizational specifications and allowing to get the organizational specifications of the general OE in different runs. Finally, we applied our approach in four Gym environments to check the impact on training, explainability and viability for our MAS design approach. Despite, being agnostic of the policy approximation functions, we think worth to investigates on linking organizational model with those directly for they could be adapted to better match the frame of organizational models. Furthermore, it enables envisioning addressing the design of MAS with organization awareness.
