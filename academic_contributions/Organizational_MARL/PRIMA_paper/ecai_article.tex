\begin{abstract}
    This paper addresses the challenge of explainability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) by proposing a novel algorithmic approach leveraging the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ Organizational Model. While previous studies have focused on understanding individual agent behaviors in traditional RL, our work emphasizes the need to elucidate the implicit cooperation among multiple agents in MARL systems. We introduce the \emph{Partial Relation between Agents' History and Organizational Model} (PRAHOM) algorithm, which links agents' histories to organizational specifications, facilitating the inference of cooperative structures from trained agents' behaviors. PRAHOM serves dual purposes: constraining the learning process based on organizational constraints and inferring organizational specifications from trained agents' histories. PRAHOM is designed to constrain agent policy spaces and generate valuable organizational specifications. Empirical evaluations conducted in cooperative Atari-like game environments validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, showing alignment with hand-crafted expectations and superior performance in some scenarios. This work seeks to contribute to AI explainability in MARL systems by offering a principled framework for understanding emergent cooperative behaviors. By bridging the gap between individual agent decision-making and cooperation, our algorithmic approach aims to enhance transparency and interpretability in complex Multi-Agent Systems.

\section{Introduction}

% Context
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical requirement for the widespread adoption of AI systems, particularly in multi-agent settings where multiple agents interact and cooperate to achieve complex goals~\cite{doshivelez2017rigorous,gunning2019xai}. While significant progress has been made in explaining the behavior of single agents~\cite{ribeiro2016classifier,lundberg2017unified}, the challenge of explicating the cooperative strategies and emergent organizational structures in MARL~\cite{busoniu2008survey} is not largely addressed~\cite{kok2006collaborative,omidshafiei2019learning}.

% Problem
For systems using MARL, a set of agents learn to achieve goals that may imply implicit cooperation and coordination. Very few works have attempted to analyze the trained agents' policies to make this cooperation explicit and attempted to handle it directly~\cite{albrecht2018survey,perolat2017pool}. This lack of explainability hinders: \quad i) the understanding of the complex social, cooperation, and coordination schemes that emerge between the trained agents in a bottom-up manner; \quad ii) the application of these schemes to agents to guide their training in a top-down manner, hence providing safety guarantees.
Addressing these concerns would improve the trust and adoption of MARL systems in real-world applications~\cite{kok2006collaborative,omidshafiei2019learning}.

% The idea of benefitting of the particularly adaptive and general MARL mechanism to get an approximated suited MAS organization and producing associated specifications, requires to link the MARL training of a set of policies in a bidirectional way with a MAS organizational model. For instance, a hierarchy described in a MAS model would constrain the possible policies to get ultimately trained in MARL. Reversely, a set of trained policies could be described in an organizational model, thus indicating resemblance with known MAS organization architectures.

% Contribution
To address this problem, we propose a first algorithmic approach called PRAHOM that leverages the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational model~\cite{Hubner2007} as a common ground to explicate the cooperative aspects in the observed agents' behaviors, or making these agents' policies constrained regarding expected cooperative schemes. The underlying idea is to establish relations between the agents' histories and the organizational specifications, such as roles, goals, or social links. These relations enable translating a joint-policy into a $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational description and/or constraining the joint-policy training regarding organizational specifications.

The characterization of organizational aspects uses predefined relations to identify matching histories as organizational specifications. Otherwise, it proposes a first incremental approach relying on a series of statistical and unsupervised learning techniques to automatically infer new raw organizational specifications from histories hence enriching known relations. A Large Language Model (LLM) could provide complementary suggested labels and explanations for these raw data in a human-like manner.
When agents are constrained to organizational specifications, joint-policies are constrained by leveraging on the relations to know expected joint-histories. These enable constraining agents to choose expected actions when required so they stick to the expected behaviors.

% This paper first informally introduce the aforementioned broad idea as a new specific research study we refer to as \textquote{Organizational Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning} (OMARL). We present DMO (Dec-POMDP $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ OMARL) a first attempt to formally describe OMARL processes using the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) as model for MARL and $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ as an organizational model. Then, we propose PRAHOM (Partial Relations between Agents' Histories and Organizational Model), a DMO process that allows both getting some organizational specifications from \textquote{trained} policies and constraining policies training with respect to given specifications. As PRAHOM only changes the action set and relies \textquote{observed} actions, it is agnostic of the MARL algorithmic approach used jointly with function approximators as policies. We used PRAHOM within a proposed design approach to generate an efficient organization and associated OCPV specifications based on the environment, the initial design constraints, and goals.

% Outline
The remainder is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of related works for XAI in MARL. Section 3 provides a fundamental background in the MARL and organizational models we used for our contribution. Section 4 presents the approach we proposed to link the MARL and organizational model. Section 5 introduces the PRAHOM algorithmic approach with its components. Section 6 describes the conducted experiments and discusses the first results of our empirical evaluation. Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.

MARL is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with each other and their environment. The goal is for a set of agents to maximize the cumulative reward over time through a process of trial and error.
MARL makes it possible to automatically converge towards policies enabling the given objective to be achieved. Reinterpreting these individual policies into organizational specifications requires work on explainability at a collective level that is rarely addressed in the literature.

In this section, we first introduce the basics PRAHOM is relying on concerning MARL and the $\mathcal{M}OISE^{+}$ organizational model. Then, we  describe how joint-policies in MARL context can be linked to the $\mathcal{M}OISE^{+}$ organizational model.

\subsection{Markovian model for MARL}

To apply MARL techniques, we rely on the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP)~\cite{Oliehoek2016} because it considers multiple agents in a similar MAS manner. It relies on stochastic processes to model uncertainty of the environment for the changes induced by actions, received observations, communication\dots \ Additionally, unlike Partially Observable Stochastic Games (POSG), the reward function can be common to agents which fosters training for collaborative-oriented actions~\cite{Beynier2013}.
A Dec-POMDP $d \in D$ (with $D$ the set of Dec-POMDP) is a 7-tuple $d = (S,\{A_i\},T,R,\{\Omega_i\},O,\gamma)$ , where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S = \{s_1,...,s_{|S|}\}$: the set of possible states;
    \item $A_{i} = \{a_{1}^{i},...,a_{|A_{i}|}^{i}\}$: the set of possible actions for agent $i$;
    \item $T$ so that $T(s,a,s') = \probP{(s'|s,a)}$ : the set of conditional transition probabilities between states;
    \item $R: S \times A \times S \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$: the reward function;
    \item $\Omega_{i} = \{o_{1}^{i},...,o_{|\Omega_{i}|}^{i}\}$: the set of observations for agent $i$;
    \item $O$ so that $O(s',a,o) = \probP{(o|s',a)}$ : the set of conditional observation probabilities;
    \item $\gamma \in [0,1]$ : the discount factor.
\end{itemize}

Considering $m$ \textbf{teams} (also referred to as \textbf{groups}) each containing several agents among $\mathcal{A}$, we also detail the minimal formalism notation we re-used for solving the Dec-POMDP for a given team $i, 0 \leq i \leq m$ containing $n$ agents~\cite{Beynier2013,Albrecht2024}:

\begin{itemize}

    \item $\Pi$: the set of policies. A \textbf{policy} $\pi \in \Pi, \pi: \Omega \rightarrow A$ deterministically maps an observation to an action. It represents the agent's internal logic;
    \item $\Pi_{joint}$: the set of joint-policies. A \textbf{joint-policy} $\pi_{joint} \in \Pi_{joint}, \pi_{joint}: \Omega^n \rightarrow A^n = \Pi^n$ chooses an action for each agent regarding their respective observation. It can be viewed as a set of policies used in agents;
    \item $H$: the set of histories. A \textbf{history} over $z \in \mathbb{N}$ steps (where $z$ is generally the maximum number of steps for an episode) is the $z$-tuple $h = ((\omega_{k}, a_{k}) | k \leq z, \omega \in \Omega, a \in A)$;
    \item $H_{joint}$: the set of joint-histories. A \textbf{joint-history} over $z \in \mathbb{N}$ steps $h_{joint} \in H_{joint}, h_{joint} = \{h_1,h_2...h_n\}$ is the set of agents' histories;
    \item $U_{joint,i}(<\pi_{joint,i}, \pi_{joint,-i}>): \Pi_{joint} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$: gives the \textbf{expected cumulative reward} over a finite horizon (if $\gamma < 1$ or the number of steps in an episode is finite), with $\pi_{joint,i}$ the joint policy for team $i$ and $\pi_{joint,-i}$ all of the other concatenated joint-policies (considered as fixed);
    \item $BR_{joint,i}(\pi_{joint,i}) = argmax_{\pi_{joint,i}}(U(<\pi_{joint,i},\pi_{joint,-i}>))$: gives the \textbf{best response} $\pi_{joint,i}^*$ in the sense that the team cannot change any of the policies in the joint-policy $\pi_{joint,i}^*$ to get a better expected cumulative reward than $U_i^* = U_{joint,i}(<\pi_{joint,i}^*, \pi_{joint,-i}>)$;
    \item $SR_{joint,i}(\pi_{joint,i}, s) = \{\pi_{joint,i} | U(<\pi_{joint,i},\pi_{joint,-i}>) \geq s\}$: gives the \textbf{sufficient response} as the set of joint-policies getting at least $s \in \mathbb{R}, s \leq U_i^*$ as expected cumulative reward.
\end{itemize}

We refer to \textbf{solving} the Dec-POMDP for the team $i$ as finding a joint policy $\pi_{joint,i} \in \Pi_{joint}, \pi_{joint,i} = BR_{joint,i}(\pi_{joint,i})$ that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over a finite horizon.
We refer to \textbf{sub-optimally solving} the Dec-POMDP at $s$ expectancy as finding the joint policies $\pi_{joint,i} \in \Pi_{joint}, \pi_{joint,i} = SR_{joint,i}(\pi_{joint,i}, s)$ that gets the expected cumulative reward over a finite horizon at least at $s \in \mathbb{R}, s \leq U_i^*$.


\subsection{Organizational model}

$\mathcal{M}OISE^+$~\cite{Hubner2007} provides a relevant high-level description of the structures and interactions within the MAS. However, we favor $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ because it provides an advanced formal description for an organization without incompatibilities with MARL, especially for a formal description of agents' policies.
Based on $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$~\cite{Hubner2007} formalism, we only give the elements of the formalism we used.

\paragraph{\textbf{Organizational specifications (OS)}} refer to some information describing an organization, we denote them as $\mathcal{OS} = \langle \mathcal{SS}, \mathcal{FS}, \mathcal{DS} \rangle$, where $\mathcal{SS}$ are the \textbf{Structural Specifications}, $\mathcal{FS}$ are the \textbf{Functional Specifications}, and $\mathcal{DS}$ are the \textbf{Deontic Specifications}

\paragraph{\textbf{Structural Specifications (SS)}} refer to the structured means left to agents to achieve a goal, we denote them as $\mathcal{SS} = \langle \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{IR}, \mathcal{G} \rangle$, where:

\begin{itemize}

    \item $\mathcal{R}_{ss}$: the set of all roles (denoted $\rho \in \mathcal{R}$);

    \item $\mathcal{IR}: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$: the inheritance relation between roles ($\mathcal{IR}(\rho_1) = \rho_2$ means $\rho_1$ inherits from $\rho_2$ also denoted $\rho_1 \sqsubset \rho_2$);

    \item $\mathcal{RG} \subseteq \mathcal{GR}$ the set of root groups, $\mathcal{GR} = \langle \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{SG}, \mathcal{L}^{intra}, \mathcal{L}^{inter}, \mathcal{C}^{intra}, \mathcal{C}^{inter}, np, ng \rangle$, the set of all groups, where

          \begin{itemize}

              \item $\mathcal{R} \subseteq \mathcal{R}_{ss}$: the set of non-abstract roles;

              \item $\mathcal{SG} \subseteq \mathcal{GR}$: the set of sub-groups;

              \item $\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{R} \cross \mathcal{R} \cross \mathcal{TL}$: the set of links. A link is a 3-tuple $(\rho_s,\rho_d,t) \in \mathcal{L}$ (also denoted as a predicate $link(\rho_s,\rho_d,t))$, where $\rho_{s}$ is the source role, $\rho_{d}$ is the destination role, and $t \in \mathcal{TL}, \mathcal{TL} = \{acq, com, aut\}$ is the link type;
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item If $t = acq$ (acquaintance), the agents playing the source role $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ are allowed to have a representation of the agents playing the destination role $\rho_{d}$;
                        \item If $t = com$ (communication), the $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ agents are allowed to communicate with $\rho_{d}$ agents;
                        \item If $t = aut$ (authority), the $\rho_{\mathrm{s}}$ agents are allowed to have authority on $\rho_{d}$ agents. It requires an acquaintance and communication link.
                    \end{itemize}
              \item $\mathcal{L}^{intra} \subseteq \mathcal{L}$: the set of intra-group links;
              \item $\mathcal{L}^{inter} \subseteq \mathcal{L}$: the set of inter-group links;

              \item $\mathcal{C} = \mathcal{R} \cross \mathcal{R}$: the set of compatibilities. A compatibility is a couple $(a,b) \in \mathcal{C}$ (also denoted $\rho_a \bowtie \rho_b$), means agents playing role $\rho_a \in \mathcal{R}$ can also play role $\rho_b \in \mathcal{R}$;
              \item $\mathcal{C}^{intra} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$: the set of intra-group compatibilities;
              \item $\mathcal{C}^{inter} \subseteq \mathcal{C}$: the set of inter-group compatibilities;

              \item $np: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$: the relation giving the cardinality of agents adopting a role;
              \item $ng: \mathcal{SG} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$: the relation giving the cardinality of each sub-group.

          \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textbf{Functional Specifications (FS)}} globally refer to the tasks and goals agents have to achieve, we denote them as $\mathcal{FS} = \langle \mathcal{SCH}, \mathcal{PO} \rangle$, where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{SCH} = \langle\mathcal{G}, \mathcal{M}, \mathcal{P}, mo, nm \rangle$: the set of \textbf{social scheme}, where:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item $\mathcal{G}$ is the set of global goal;

              \item $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of mission labels;
              \item $\mathcal{P} = \langle \mathcal{G}, \{\mathcal{G}\}^s, OP, [0,1] \rangle, s \in \mathbb{N}^*$ is the set of plans that builds the tree structure of the goals.
                    %
                    A plan $p \in \mathcal{P}$ is 4-tuple $p=(g_f,\{g_i\}_{0 \leq i \leq s}, op, ps), g_f \in \mathcal{G}, g_i \in \mathcal{G}, op \in OP, OP = \{sequence, choice, parallel\}, ps \in [0,1]$, meaning that the goal $g_f$ is achieved if some of the sub-goals $g_i$ are achieved with a success probability $ps$ and according to the operator $op$:
                    %
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item if $op = sequence$, the $g_i$ can only be achieved in the same order sequentially;
                        \item if $op = choice$, only one of the $g_i$ has to be achieved;
                        \item if $op = parallel$, the $g_i$ can only be achieved sequentially or simultaneously.
                    \end{itemize}

              \item $mo: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{G})$: specifies the set of goals a mission is associated with;
              \item $nm: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ the cardinality of agents committed for each mission.
          \end{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{PO}: \mathcal{M} \cross \mathcal{M}$: the set of \textbf{preference orders}. A preference order is a couple $(m_1, m_2), m_1 \in \mathcal{M}, m_2 \in \mathcal{M}$ (also denoted $m_{1} \prec m_{2}$) meaning that if there is a moment when an agent is permitted to commit to $m_{1}$ and also $m_{2}$, it has a social preference for committing to $m_{1}$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\textbf{Deontic Specifications (DS)}} refer to how SS are to be used to achieve the FS, we denote them as $\mathcal{DS} = \langle \mathcal{OBL},\mathcal{PER} \rangle$, the set of deontic specifications, where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{TC}$: the set of \textbf{time constraints}. A time constraint $tc \in \mathcal{TC}$ specifies a set of periods during which a permission or obligation is valid ($Any \in \mathcal{TC}$ means \textquote{everytime});
    \item $\mathcal{OBL}: \mathcal{R} \cross \mathcal{M} \cross \mathcal{TC}$: the set of \textbf{obligations}. An obligation is a 3-tuple $(\rho_a,m,tc)$ (also denoted $obl(\rho_a,m,tc)$) meaning an agent playing role $\rho_a \in \mathcal{R}$ is obliged to commit on mission $m \in \mathcal{M}$ for a given time constraint $tc \in \mathcal{TC}$;
    \item $\mathcal{PER}$: the set of \textbf{permissions}. A permission is a 3-tuple $(\rho_a,m,tc)$ (also denoted $per(\rho_a,m,tc)$) meaning an agent playing role $\rho_a \in \mathcal{R}$ is permitted to commit on mission $m \in \mathcal{M}$ for a given time constraint $tc \in \mathcal{TC}$;
\end{itemize}


\section{Linking MARL and Organizational model}

We propose \emph{Organizational oriented MARL} (OMARL) as all the processes linking MARL and organizational models for being able to get information from joint-policies to build an organizational model and constraining possible output joint-policies subset regarding organizational specifications. We define \emph{Dec-POMDP $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ OMARL} (DMO) as all the OMARL processes using the Dec-POMDP for MARL and $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ for the organizational model.

In a DMO process, we consider solving sub-optimally the Dec-POMDP $d \in D$ for a single team $i$ (comprising $n$ agents in $\mathcal{A}$) at $s = U_i^* - \delta$ (with $\delta \in \mathbb{R}$) expectancy, we may obtain a set $S\Pi_{joint,i,s} = SR_{d,joint,i}(\pi_{joint,i},s) = \{\pi_{joint,i,s,1}, \pi_{joint,i,s,2} ... \pi_{joint,i,s,m}\}$ with the $\pi_{joint,i,s,k} \in \Pi_{joint}$ ($k \in \mathbb{N}, k \leq m$) and $SR_{d,joint,i}(\pi_{joint,i},s)$ giving the sub-optimal joint-policies at $s$ expectancy for the Dec-POMDP $d$ also denoted $SR_{joint,i,s}(d)$. For instance, we may have $m$ different convergent joint-policies reaching a given expected cumulative reward after training several times due to non-deterministic parameters in training.

Yet as an extra constraint, it is required to have only the joint-policies satisfying the constraining organizational specifications $\mathcal{OS}_{cons}$ we denote $S\Pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons}} = \{\pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons},1}, \pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons},2} ... \pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons},b}\}$ with $b \in \mathbb{N}$ and the $\pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons},k} \in \Pi_{joint}$ ($k \in \mathbb{N}, k \leq b$). Then, one can envision using the sub-optimal joint-policies that satisfy the specifications $S\Pi_{joint,i,s} \cap S\Pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons}}$, on which we can infer further associated specifications $\mathcal{OS}_{i,s}$ of the implicit resulting organization.

As a first approach, a general definition for a DMO process is a relation between the sub-optimal joint-policies set and associated organizational specifications set the following way (\autoref{rel:def_dmo}):

\

\begin{relation}\label{rel:def_dmo}
    dmo: D \times \mathcal{OS}_{cons} \rightarrow (S\Pi_{joint,i,s} \cap S\Pi_{joint,i,\mathcal{OS}_{cons}}) \times \mathcal{OS}_{i,s}
\end{relation}
Can be understood as for a given problem comprising an environment and a global goal to be achieved by agents, and some design constraints; we can possibly get sufficiently successfully trained agents that are compliant with given specifications, and some associated organizational specifications.

In practice, implementing a DMO process faces two main issues:
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The intractability in analyzing policies directly because policy function approximations (such as neural networks) are generally difficult to explain hence hindering the extraction of organizational specifications;
    \item The lack of common ground between policies and organizational specifications enabling to know how agents are expected to behave when they are constrained to stick to organizational specifications. Reversely, there is no way to characterize any organizational specifications regarding behavior induced by agents' policies.
\end{enumerate}

To address issue (1), we hypothesize that for a single deterministic policy $\pi_q: \Omega_q \rightarrow A_q$ having been played over $l \in \mathbb{N}$ episodes hence $H_l = \{\langle (\omega_{j,k}, a_{j,k}), 0 \leq k \leq p_l, p_l \in \mathbb{N}, \omega_k \in \Omega_q, a_k \in A_q \rangle, 0 \leq j \leq l\}$, if there is $e \in \mathbb{N}$, $l \geq e$ and if many different observations $|\{\omega_{j,k}, 0 \leq j \leq l, 0 \leq k \leq p_l\}|$ are obtained, then the difference between the actual policy and the reconstructed policy $\pi_q^r: = \{(\omega_{j,k}, a_{j,k}), 0 \leq j \leq l, 0 \leq k \leq p_l\}$ is small $\delta_q^r = \pi_q \backslash \pi_q^r, |\delta_q^r| \leq b, 0 \leq b \leq |\pi_q|, b \in \mathbb{N}$. We may also extend this hypothesis' outline to non-deterministic policies reorganizing the $(\omega_{j,k}, a_{j,k})$ couples into a probabilistic decision tree where nodes are observations whose outgoing edges are the likely actions weighted with a probability as $(a, p), a \in A, p \in [0,1]$ couples.

Indeed, we hypothesize we can approximate the apparent behavior of a deterministic policy by saving enough representative observation-action couples we can observe. Thus, instead of analyzing policies directly, we only take agents' histories (obtained by letting play policies) into account to analyze their behaviors.

Continuing the previous approach, we address issue (2) by introducing a relation $osh: \mathcal{OS} \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(H_{joint})$ theoretically linking any organizational specification to a subset of expected joint-histories (practically expressed in a short way as patterns).
Using that relation, we proposed \autoref{rel:def_extended_dmo}, which is indeed shown compliant with initial $dmo$ definition in \autoref{rel:def_dmo}\footnotemark[1].% definition \autoref{rel:def_dmo}.

\

From \autoref{rel:def_extended_dmo}, except from regular MARL training, we notice a DMO process intended contribution to be represented by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $rct[osh[\mathcal{OS}_{cons}]]$: highlighting the need to know the expected joint-histories for given organizational specifications and how to use these joint-histories to constrain the joint-policies during training. We define this process according to the relation $osh\_training: \mathcal{OS}_{cons} \rightarrow \Pi_{joint}$.
    \item $osh^{-1}[obs[SR_{joint,i,s}[D]] \cap osh[\mathcal{OS}_{cons}]]$: highlighting the need to sample (optionally constrained) joint-histories and to infer organizational specifications from them. We define this process according to the relation $hos: SH_{joint} \rightarrow \mathcal{OS}$
\end{enumerate}

Addressing the implementation of these intended contributions led to the development of the PRAHOM algorithmic approach as a first attempt to implement a DMO process.

\section{PRAHOM algorithmic approach}

Continuing the previous decomposition in two activities, we detailed our process to get the specifications out of the agents' policies as \emph{PRAHOM\_hos} presented in \autoref{alg:PRAHOM-hos}; and the process to get the joint-policies satisfying given specifications as \emph{PRAHOM\_osh\_training} presented in \autoref{alg:PRAHOM-osh-training}. PRAHOM is then a synthesis of these two processes presented in \autoref{alg:PRAHOM}.

PRAHOM first launches the training of a joint-policy model on the given environment under organizational constraints relying on given relations. It enables getting the joint-policies that reach the given expectancy. Then, each of these joint-policies is played within differently generated environments to get all the joint-histories. Finally, these joint-histories are analyzed to infer the associated organizational specifications enriching known relations.

\subsection{\textbf{Inferring OS from joint-histories}}

\input{algos/PRAHOM_hos.tex}\label{alg:PRAHOM_hos}

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \centering
    \input{figures/gosia_illustrative_view.tex}
    \caption{GOSIA illustrative view}
    \label{fig:gosia_illustrative_view}
\end{figure*}

The proposed \autoref{alg:PRAHOM_hos} implements \emph{PRAHOM\_hos}. Its underlying principle is first to rely on the proposed \emph{Knowledge-based Organizational Specification Identification Approach} (KOSIA) to identify some organizational specifications thanks to the current $osh$ relations. % KOSIA is aimed to be relevant when knowledge of the relations between histories and organizational specifications is significant enough to be used generally.
For instance, we implemented KOSIA as a pattern-matching engine finding similar joint-histories $Im(osh)$ to a given one hence finding the associated organizational specifications.

Otherwise, if it is not possible to get all known associated organizational specifications, the proposed \emph{General Organizational Specification Inference Approach} (GOSIA) suggests an empirical approach to infer the rest of them.
GOSIA is based on some proposed definitions for each $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational specification regarding joint-histories or other organizational specifications, to use suggested specific statistical, unsupervised learning techniques to infer them incrementally. The \autoref{fig:gosia_illustrative_view} summarizes the five steps of GOSIA (represented as arrow labels in \autoref{fig:gosia_illustrative_view}) that are detailed below.
%
\paragraph{1) Infer roles and their inheritance}

We propose a role $\rho$ is defined as a policy whose the associated histories of agents having adopted it all contain a common discontinuous sequence. We proposed a role $\rho_2$ inherits $\rho_2$ if the common discontinuous sequence of the histories associated with $\rho_2$ is also contained in the $\rho_1$'s one.
From these definitions, GOSIA leverages hierarchical sequence clustering to find the longest common discontinuous sequences among agent's histories. Results can represented as a dendrogram. It enables inferring roles and inheritance relations, their respective relation with histories, and the current agents as well.

\paragraph{2) Infer possible organizations}

We propose an organization is linked to only one set of all instantiable roles sharing closely similar inheritance relations. Indeed, considering two trained joint-policies $H_{joint,i,s,1}$ and $H_{joint,i,s,2}$, even though both achieve a goal relying on the roles $\mathcal{R}_{ss,1}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{ss,2}$ may be far from other. For instance, their roles may not use the same responsibility distribution.
GOSIA uses a K-means algorithm to get the $q$ clusters of the vectorized $\mathcal{IR}_{i}$ considered as organizations. The roles in the same cluster share the inheritance relations of the K-means' centroid $\mathcal{IR}_j$. Indeed, they are representative general roles regarding all the similar roles adopted by agents of the same organization over all joint-histories.
For the next steps, only one chosen organization and its related joint-histories are considered. When it exists it chooses an organization close to KOSIA's one.

\paragraph{3) Infer links and sub-groups}

We propose two agents have a \emph{social impact link} $(ag_1,ag_2, \kappa, \delta, f)$ with $h_1$ associated with $ag_1$ and $h_2$ associated with $ag_2$ if a sequence $h_{1,s}$ in $h_1$ is correlated at a $\kappa \in [0,1]$ index to another sequence $h_{2,s}$ in $h_2$ positioned at a relative delay $\delta \in [0,1]$ after the beginning of $h_{1,s}$, and these two correlated sequences are $f$ frequently present among all joint-policies.
We consider two agents to be in the same group if there is a social impact link such as $f \geq 0.9$. Considering that $\kappa$ indicates the likeliness of an agent' sequence to impact another one and that $\delta$ indicates the receiver's reactivity, we consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item an acquaintance link $(ag_1,ag_2,acq)$ is defined if there is a social impact link with $\kappa \geq 0.1$, $\delta \geq 0$, $f \geq 0$;
    \item a communication link $(ag_1,ag_2,com)$ is defined if there is a social impact link with $\kappa \geq 0.3$, $\delta \geq 0$, $f \geq 0$;
    \item an authority link $(ag_1,ag_2,aut)$ is defined if there is a social impact link with $\kappa \geq 0.9$, $\delta \geq 0.5$, $f \geq 0$.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Generaliser à plusieurs agents ou le dire en tant que limitation
GOSIA uses empirical techniques to compute a graph of the social impact links between agents. Frequency enables determining clusters as agents' groups and their associated roles. It enables inferring the acquaintance, communication, and authority links between roles. From the information concerning roles associated with groups, it is possible to infer whether links are intra-group or inter-group.

\paragraph{4) Infer goals, plans, and missions}

We propose a sub-goal/goal is a set of common states that are reached following the histories of the successful agents.
For each joint-history GOSIA computes the state transition graph that is merged into a general one. Measuring the distance between two vectorized states within K-means enables finding the clusters of trajectories that some agents may follow. Then, we sampled some sets of states for each trajectory as goals. For instance, one may choose the narrowest set of states in which agents collectively seem to transition at some point to achieve their goal. Otherwise, a balanced sampling over lower variance trajectories could be made. Knowing what goal belongs to what trajectory, GOSIA infers plans for choice and sequence only.

This enables getting goals and plans at a global state but these goals could be indeed split into specific goals for each sub-group and agent. To do this, GOSIA conducts the same process replacing the states with the observations of the agents in the same sub-group for sub-groups, and observations for agents.

We propose a mission as the set of sub-goals one or several agents are achieving.
Knowing what shared goals are achieved by agents, GOSIA determines some sets of representative goals as missions.

\paragraph{5) Infer compatibilities, obligations, permissions, and cardinalities}

We propose an obligation is when an agent playing role $\rho$ is achieving a mission's goals and no other one at some time constraints while an obligation is when an agent playing role $\rho$ may achieve some other ones at some time constraints.
GOSIA determines what agents' are associated with what mission and if they are restricted to some hence these are obligations or just permission

We propose a compatibility $(\rho_1,\rho_2)$ is defined if an agent playing a history associated with $\rho_1$ in a joint-history also plays a history associated with $\rho_2$ in another joint-history. If this change operates only in the same group, then it is intra-group. Else it is inter-group.

Finally, by counting the number of agents playing a role in each joint-history, each role's cardinality is computed. Similarly, GOSIA computes each sub-group's cardinality counting the inferred ones.

\paragraph{Perspective of complementary help from LLMs}

We started experimenting \emph{EleutherAI} \emph{gpt-neo-2.7B} pre-trained transformer using \emph{Transformers}' \emph{Huggingface} library. Within \emph{PRAHOM\_hos} it is intended to be automatically prompt-engineered with generated specific contextual descriptions of the environment, its functioning, and the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ organizational specifications. This prompt-engineering is to guide the answers towards three main purposes:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*),itemjoin={;\quad}]
    \item Labeling, tagging the inferred organizational specification from related joint-histories in a human-like manner;
    \item Giving specific human-like textual description about each organizational specification;
    \item Giving general human-like textual description of the whole organization.
\end{enumerate*}
Despite, being at an early stage of use in our contribution, the first results obtained with LLMs show to be a promising research focus to assist the human understanding.

\subsection{\textbf{Constraining joint-policies satisfying OS}}

\input{algos/PRAHOM_osh_training.tex}

We consider a given MARL algorithm that iteratively converges towards a joint-policy so that the joint-policy is updated at each step until a finite horizon.
%In \autoref{proof:jpc_to_ac}
We consider that restricting the actions according to the organizational specifications at each step allows constraining the converged joint-policies to the ones that satisfy the organizational specifications\footnotemark[1]. Relying on that principle we propose \emph{PRAHOM\_osh\_training} presented in \autoref{alg:PRAHOM-osh-training}.

\emph{PRAHOM\_osh\_training} fits within a regular MARL context: joint-policy $\pi_{joint,ep}$ is updated after several steps allowing to have enough joint-histories $h_{joint,ep}$ and joint-rewards as feedback $r_{joint,ep}$. The training goes on over several episodes for better training until converging to a sufficient cumulative reward regarding $s$. New training are launched until $it_{max}$ times to get more joint-policies to add in $s\pi_{joint}$ as a final result.

\emph{PRAHOM\_osh\_training} augments that framework by changing the way agents choose their actions to meet the expectations of the organizational specifications. Using the known relations $osh$ with agents' constraints $cons[\mathcal{A}]$, $cons\_act$ has to guess the most expected actions regarding the current $h_{joint,ep}$. In practice, a decision tree reconstructed from the $osh[cons[\mathcal{A}]]$ allows getting the expected actions by following the specific episode joint-history $h_{joint,ep}$. These expected joint-actions $a_{joint,exp}$ are to be chosen by agents.

Two modes are available to integrate these constraints:
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*),itemjoin={;\quad}]
    \item \textquote{correct-mode}: Correct any unexpected action by an expected one (such as a random sample). It aims to converge faster by reducing the search space with safety guarantees. Yet, it is external to the agent's policy;
    \item \textquote{penalize-mode}: Add a penalty to the reward if any wrong action has been made among agents. This mode aims to make agents \textquote{learn} to respect their constraints. Yet, no safety guarantee is ensured since agents only approximate their expected behavior.
\end{enumerate*}

%   - mesures utilisées pour évaluer l'efficacité de notre algo et fournir un aperçu du processus de collecte et d'analyse des données.

To assess PRAHOM, we assess it in PettingZoo~\cite{Terry2021} environments where several agents have to achieve a goal with the best performance through various collective strategies. Pettingzoo is a library that offers a standard API simplifying the development of multi-agent environments and facilitates the use of MARL algorithms.

We developed \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo Wrapper}\footnotemark[2] as a \emph{PoC} tool augmenting a Pettingzoo environment to help apply PRAHOM. It provides a series of additional class methods implementing some PRAHOM's functionalities to ease the training (with \emph{Proximal Policy Optimization}) and the organizational specifications inference. We selected three Atari environments for their visual rendering is a convenient way to assess the results with manual observations\footnotemark[1].
%
\footnotetext[2]{An early contribution of \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo Wrapper} for side application topics has been accepted for the 20th AIAI Conference~\cite{soule2024aomea-anonymous}.}
%
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*),itemjoin={;\quad}]
    \item \textquote{Pistonball} (PBL)~\cite{Terry2021} is a series of pistons to bring a ball from right to left side hence requiring neighbors' representation;
    \item \textquote{Predator-prey with communication}~\cite{Lowe2017} (PPY) consists of predators monitored by a leader to catch faster prey hence requiring hunting strategies;
    \item \textquote{Knights Archers Zombies}~\cite{Terry2021} (KAZ) consists in knights and archers learning how to kill zombies hence requiring efficient agent spatial positioning.
\end{enumerate*}
%
We applied PRAHOM in three cases:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\roman*),itemjoin={;\quad}]
    \item No organizational specifications (NTS): agents have to learn efficient collective strategies without any constraints or indications
    \item Partially constraining organizational specifications (PTS): some constraints are given to help converge faster
    \item Fully constraining organizational specifications (FTS): manually crafted joint-policies are given for they are a reference regarding learned ones.
\end{enumerate*}
%
Details of the constraints for NTS and FTS are not presented here (available in code\footnotemark[1]).

\

We conducted an empirical evaluation of the way \emph{PRAHOM} may impact the training when constrained by organizational specifications. We determined approximated reward ratios between PTS, NTS, and FTS after 1000 episodes. For all episodes, performance stability is the average performance over the maximal one. It shows how the trained agents can achieve the goal in a consistent way in differently generated environments. Results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:training_AOMEA_results}.

As a general observation, we can notice convergence time is longer for NTS than for PTS which is also longer than for FTS. As expected, the search space is decreasing, hence a shorter convergence time. For instance, we noticed a faster convergence to a sub-optimal solution in the PBL environment by providing organizational specifications as presented in \autoref{fig:prahom_learning_curve}. Although PTS converges faster than NTS to a comparable cumulative reward, NTS may outperform PTS because trained agents' policies are hand-tailored to solve the problem finely.

    \label{fig:prahom_learning_curve}
\end{figure}

We also conducted a qualitative analysis of the resulting roles, links, and goals determined by PRAHOM after training.
%
For the PBL environment, we noticed roles being equivalent for agents are expected to act the same. Indeed, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) presented in \autoref{fig:prahom_pca_analysis} of the agents' histories, shows most agents’ histories are in the left bottom zone (circled in red). It shows most pistons seem to act similarly as expected. One of the inferred sub-goals consists in having the ball in mid-way which is indeed coherent with expectations.
%
For the KAZ environment, we noticed acquaintance links due to each other's representation and two distinct roles: archers tend to move away from zombies, and knights tend to approach them. Despite the inferred sub-goals diversity, some indicate to have knights at the top while archers stay at the bottom as expected.
%
For the PPY environment, we noticed the output specifications indicate authority links between the leader predator and the simple predators. These are probably to be related to some inferred sub-goals that seem to indicate an approximated circling purpose.

% Multi-agent methods rely on the designer's knowledge to design a suitable MAS organization, but do not provide automatic means to determine the relevant organizational mechanisms only from the design requirements and the overall objective.
% MARL techniques have been successfully applied to automatically train agents to achieve a given objective without explicit characterization of emerging collective strategies.

It links the agents' policies (modeled in a Dec-POMDP) with $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ through the process PRAHOM. Under the simplifying conditions of a group and a single social pattern, PRAHOM makes it possible to partially determine organizational specifications from joint histories and to constrain the training of policies in relation to organizational specifications.
% Additionally, we implemented the \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo} wrapper as a proof of concept to apply PRAHOM.
% Finally, we applied our approach in four \emph{PettingZoo} environments to evaluate the impact during and after training. The performances obtained appear to be comparable to those known.

% Key point summary

Our main contribution is the PRAHOM algorithmic approach that aims to link MARL and agents' policies with the $\mathcal{M}OISE^+$ model leveraging on relations between joint-histories and organizational specifications. It seeks to determine organizational specifications from trained agents to help understand the agents' collective behavior. It also seeks to constrain the agents' training according to expected behaviors expressed as organizational specifications.
As a first implementation, \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo Wrapper} is assessed in cooperative Atari games, where the inferred organizational specifications generally match the expected hand-crafted results.
Despite the implementation's limited functionalities, the first results showed that the PRAHOM approach can be used to constrain the resulting agents' policy space according to the specified organizational constraints. Additionally, we manually verified that some valuable organizational specifications are inferred from trained agents' histories.

% Perspectives
Even if PRAHOM is agnostic of any MARL algorithm, reconstructing the collective behaviors of agents a posteriori can prove difficult. Indeed, major perspectives to improve PRAHOM are inspired by hierarchical learning which contributes to better characterizing emerging strategies during learning.
Eventually, even though the first results obtained with LLM show it as a promising complementary help for PRAHOM, it may also bring out new ways for explaining collective behavior beyond its intended use.
% Ultimately, we also aim to improve the applicability of PRAHOM by developing dedicated interfaces built around PRAHOM making it more accessible to industrial and research contexts.
