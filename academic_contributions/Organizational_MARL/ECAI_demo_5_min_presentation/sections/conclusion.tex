                    \item A \textbf{Dec-POMDP} modeling of networked node likely to be attacked and defended by agents.
                    \item A first \textbf{work in progress simulator} whose some capabilities have been assessed through a \textbf{MITRE ATT\&CK} scenario.

            \begin{alertblock}{Perspectives}
                To meet the \textbf{AICA} needs, we identified some limitations to overcome:

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item More \textbf{realistic} scenarios so agents can explore and act as in seemingly similar to reality information systems;
                    \item Ease the \textbf{transfer learning} of trained agent models from simulations to emulated or real systems;
                    \item More \textbf{coordination} between agents, especially leveraging on communication to reach a goal\dots
                \end{itemize}
