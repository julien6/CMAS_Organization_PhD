    \begin{prosblock}{AOMEA as main contribution}
        \textbf{AOMEA's originality}: augment a MARL process with an explicit organizational model for methodological purposes
    \end{prosblock}

    \begin{prosblock}{PRAHOM as a sub-contribution}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo wrapper} as a Proof of Concept for practically applying AOMEA;
            \item We assessed it enables getting some OS that satisfy the design constraints and allow achieving the given goal.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{prosblock}

    \begin{alertblock}{Perspectives}
        \emph{PRAHOM} use histories to reconstruct collective behaviors $\rightarrow$ difficult
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Go further with supervised and non-supervised learning techniques
            \item Investigating recent works in MARL techniques such as hierarchical learning;
            \item Applying \emph{Large Language Models} to provide complimentary textual descriptions of OS described by histories.
        \end{itemize}
