    \begin{prosblock}{AOMEA as a main contribution}
        \textbf{AOMEA's originality}: augment a MARL process with an explicit organizational model for MAS design methodological purposes.
    \end{prosblock}

    \begin{prosblock}{PRAHOM as a sub-contribution}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \emph{PRAHOM PettingZoo wrapper} as a Proof of Concept for practically applying AOMEA;
            \item Enables getting some OS that satisfy the design constraints and allow achieving given goals.
        \end{itemize}

    \end{prosblock}

    \begin{alertblock}{Perspectives}
        \emph{PRAHOM} use histories to reconstruct collective behaviors $\rightarrow$ \textbf{difficult}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Go further with \textbf{supervised} and \textbf{non-supervised learning} techniques
            \item Investigating recent works in MARL techniques such as \textbf{hierarchical learning};
            \item \emph{Large Language Models} for complimentary textual descriptions of OS defined by histories.
        \end{itemize}
