                \begin{itemize}
                    \item A Dec-POMDP modeling of networked node likely to be attacked and defended by agents.
                    \item A first simulator whose some capabilities have been assessed through a MITRE ATT\&CK scenario.
                \end{itemize}

            \begin{alertblock}{Perspectives}
                To meet the AICA needs, we identified the main limitations to overcome:

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item More realistic scenarios so agents can explore and act as in seemingly similar to reality information systems;
                    \item Ease the transfer learning of trained agent models from simulations to emulated or real systems;
                    \item More coordination between agents, especially leveraging on communication to reach a goal\dots;
                    \item Constraints for actions (such as cost, execution duration, etc.).
                \end{itemize}
