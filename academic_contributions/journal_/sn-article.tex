%% Abstract
\abstract{
Explainability in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is crucial for understanding and validating the behavior of agents in complex environments. This paper introduces two complementary approaches, KOSIA (Knowledge Organizational Specification Identification Approach) and GOSIA (General Organization Specification Inference Approach), to enhance the explicability of MARL systems. We investigate the strengths and limitations of various techniques for GOSIA, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. Our contributions address existing gaps in the literature and propose new methodologies for improving transparency in MARL.
