  abstract  = "This book offers a structured overview and a comprehensive guide
               to the emerging field of Autonomous Intelligent Cyber Defense
               Agents (AICA). The book discusses the current technical issues
               in autonomous cyber defense and offers information on practical
               design approaches. The material is presented in a way that is
               accessible to non-specialists, with tutorial information
               provided in the initial chapters and as needed throughout the
               book. The reader is provided with clear and comprehensive
               background and reference material for each aspect of AICA.
               Today's cyber defense tools are mostly watchers. They are not
               active doers. They do little to plan and execute responses to
               attacks, and they don't plan and execute recovery activities.
               Response and recovery -- core elements of cyber resilience --
               are left to human cyber analysts, incident responders and system
               administrators. This is about to change. The authors advocate
               this vision, provide detailed guide to how such a vision can be
               realized in practice, and its current state of the art. This
               book also covers key topics relevant to the field, including
               functional requirements and alternative architectures of AICA,
               how it perceives and understands threats and the overall
               situation, how it plans and executes response and recovery, how
               it survives threats, and how human operators deploy and control
               AICA. Additionally, this book covers issues of testing, risk,
               and policy pertinent to AICA, and provides a roadmap towards
               future R\&D in this field. This book targets researchers and
               advanced students in the field of cyber defense and resilience.
               Professionals working in this field as well as developers of
               practical products for cyber autonomy will also want to purchase
               this book.",

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning is of rising importance in cybersecurity. The primary objective of applying machine learning in cybersecurity is to make the process of malware detection more actionable, scalable and effective than traditional approaches, which require human intervention. The cybersecurity domain involves machine learning challenges that require efficient methodical and theoretical handling. Several machine learning and statistical methods, such as deep learning, support vector machines and Bayesian classification, among others, have proven effective in mitigating cyber-attacks. The detection of hidden trends and insights from network data and building of a corresponding data-driven machine learning model to prevent these attacks is vital to design intelligent security systems. In this survey, the focus is on the machine learning techniques that have been implemented on cybersecurity data to make these systems secure. Existing cybersecurity threats and how machine learning techniques have been used to mitigate these threats have been discussed. The shortcomings of these state-of-the-art models and how attack patterns have evolved over the past decade have also been presented. Our goal is to assess how effective these machine learning techniques are against the ever-increasing threat of malware that plagues our online community.},

title="Simulation framework for practical cyber security training in the public service",
abstract="The public service sector is a key target of cyberattacks. In order to prevent and effectively tackle such attacks, organisations should continuously develop their defence capabilities. As part of developing such capabilities, public service cybersecurity training is required to teach students about cyberattacks. The present study uses quantitative research techniques including (i) how to identify key requirements for the practical aspects of public service cybersecurity training and (ii) sampling to utilise international best practices from cybersecurity education and conceptual architectures from existing public service organisations. A schematic structure with a two-level practical training course is proposed. On the first level, the students learn about the defence mechanisms of their own info-communication devices and try to prevent attacks in a simulated environment. On the second level, the students apply protection strategies against cyberattacks in organisational infrastructure. Finally, a technical framework is defined to simulate cyberattacks against (a) personal devices and (b) a fictional organisational infrastructure. The specification of a public service cybersecurity training programme should not only focus on theoretical education but also provide practical knowledge to students. By simulating specific attacks, theoretical and practical knowledge can be combined. As a result, students will be able to recognise threats and potential risks from cyberspace.",

Work has focused on the integration of cyberwarfare communication effects into a live–virtual–constructive (LVC) environment in order to better represent a network centric battlespace subject to cyber-attack, at a large force level. In addition, virtual cyber ranges have been developed. A virtual cyber range is a portable modeling and simulation framework that provides a real-time, hardware-in-the-loop capability for simulation of cyber threats to the entire net-centric infrastructure. The framework enables interoperability with LVC simulations, providing training and assessment of human-in-the-loop performance. This work builds on previous work and shows the need for a framework to support the modeling and simulation of cyber-attack and defense for training and assessment. This work does focus on cybersecurity for wireless communications, but the focus is on large network-centric systems at force level. Furthermore, there are published descriptions of research focused on the use of multi-agent systems in vehicle-to-vehicle communication and autonomous driving systems, such as Google’s driverless car. While the vehicles are commercial by nature, there are many similarities to military autonomous vehicles (MAVs), in their system components and architecture as well as the cybersecurity threats that they face. While these works are related to the work presented in this paper, with their focus on synthetic environments and commercial autonomous systems, they are not closely related. The focus of this paper is on small point to point and point to multipoint wireless networks, comprised of only a few nodes, with the nodes representing MAVs and controllers. The US Army, Air Force, and Navy are continuing to increase their use of these systems, and are now focusing on cybersecurity. Due to the lagging focus on wireless networks and autonomous vehicles, there is not much published work that is related. Current unmanned systems were not built with cybersecurity considerations taken into account, and are thus vulnerable to cyber-attack. The objective of this paper is to present and describe the need for a cyber-attack and defense simulation framework to support the modeling and simulation for cybersecurity of autonomous vehicle systems used by US Armed Forces. These autonomous vehicle systems include unmanned aerial systems and unmanned ground systems. The paper describes a notional framework to support this type of modeling, as well as a detailed use case and example cyber-attack simulation system. }

abstract="A model of a structured query language injection attack was designed using the Petri nets with players, strategies, and costs formalism. The formalism models the attacker and defender as competing players that can observe a specific subset of the net and act by changing the transition firing rates that the respective player can control. This model of the attack was based on the Common Attack Pattern and Enumeration Classification database and was validated by a panel of subject matter experts to be representative of a structured query language injection attack. The model was simulated with a reinforcement learning algorithm using an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}upvarepsilon {\$}{\$}-greedy selection method. The algorithm learned within each iteration an optimal solution by varying player-controlled transitions rates.
