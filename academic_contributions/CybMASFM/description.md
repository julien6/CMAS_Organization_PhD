# CybMASFM : Cyberdefense Multi-Agent System Formal Model

## Abstract
Collaboration among taylored cyber-defender agents in a networked host system is a promising approach to tackle cyber-attacks as close as entry points. Indeed, flexible organizations among agents would allow to handle scalability and adaptivity issues relying on self/re-organization mechanisms. Such agents are making up a cyberdefense multi-agent system to be deployed and operate to reach a cyberdefense goal in any host system. Before empirically trying to implement such a CMAS, we consider addressing deployment environmental constraints

## Overview

Our motivation for CybMASFM is to position our own contribution among MAS concepts and related works as for organization. In order to do so, we propose 

An agent is a software entity deployed on any host system as a daemon.
For example, its source code can be Python, Java, C/C++, etc and running on a Linux or Windows.
As any software program, it requires computing and memory resources such as CPU and RAM usage.
It is able to apply action such as reading, writing, modifying, executing files, sending commands, etc.
After applying action, an agent get observations such as file content, modification acknowledgement, command's output, etc.
Based upon these observations, a decision making process is played to choose the next action to play. That decision making process can range from very simple ones such as random or reactive to complex ones such as cognitive process, reinforcement learning, etc.

In game theory, that decision making process is called a "strategy" and is represented as a mathematical relation associating any situation to an action.
Furthermore, in Dec-POMDP formalism, that relation is also called "behavior" or "policy" and it associates observations to an action.
