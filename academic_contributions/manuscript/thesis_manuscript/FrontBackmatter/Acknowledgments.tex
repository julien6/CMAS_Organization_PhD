\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

Doing a Ph.D. can feel like a lonely road, but I definitely didn’t walk it alone.

First off, I want to thank my supervisors, Jean-Paul, Michel, Louis-Marie, and Paul. They guided me through this whole process, letting me experience what research is all about—mistakes included—but also stepping in when needed. They were always there for me, even during their vacations, taking the time to review my thesis manuscript.

A big thank you also goes to my jury members: X1 and X2, for their reviews, X2 for taking on the role of Jury President, and X3 for reviewing my work throughout my Ph.D.

I met so many incredible Ph.D. students during my time in the lab that it would be impossible to name them all here, even though they all deserve recognition. But I’d especially like to mention Arthur, Vincent, Thinh, Karem, and Ihab for making me feel welcome. Minh Tuan, Sebastien, and Max—thank you for your kindness and all the great conversations.

I’m also really grateful to François Suro and Simon Gay, who gave me regular feedback and kept me on track when I was motivated but still lacking some confidence in my work.

A shoutout to Romain Liévin and Oum-el-Kheir Aktouf for helping me with my first teaching experiences. Working at LCIS wouldn’t have been nearly as manageable without Caroline, Carole, and Marie. You helped me navigate the mountain of administrative stuff—and Marie, your cooking was a lifesaver!

I also want to thank my friends Dorian and Thomas, who are also on this Ph.D. journey, as well as Joaquin, who was always there to help me take a break from thinking about my studies.

And last but definitely not least, I owe everything to my family, who have supported me unconditionally throughout my life. None of this would have been possible without them.
