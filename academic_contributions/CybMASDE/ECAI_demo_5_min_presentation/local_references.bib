abstract="A model of a structured query language injection attack was designed using the Petri nets with players, strategies, and costs formalism. The formalism models the attacker and defender as competing players that can observe a specific subset of the net and act by changing the transition firing rates that the respective player can control. This model of the attack was based on the Common Attack Pattern and Enumeration Classification database and was validated by a panel of subject matter experts to be representative of a structured query language injection attack. The model was simulated with a reinforcement learning algorithm using an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}upvarepsilon {\$}{\$}-greedy selection method. The algorithm learned within each iteration an optimal solution by varying player-controlled transitions rates. This paper describes the validation of the model, the design of the algorithm, and the results from 4 different {\$}{\$}{\backslash}upvarepsilon {\$}{\$}-values.",

ABSTRACT = {A new kind of malware called Mirai is spreading like wildfire. Mirai is characterized by targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Since IoT devices are increasing explosively, it is not realistic to manage their vulnerability by human-wave tactics. This paper proposes a new approach that uses a white-hat worm to fight malware. The white-hat worm is an extension of an IoT worm called Hajime and introduces lifespan and secondary infectivity (the ability to infect a device infected by Mirai). The proposed white-hat worm was expressed as a formal model with agent-oriented Petri nets called PN 2 . The model enables us to simulate a battle between the white-hat worm and Mirai. The result of the simulation evaluation shows that (i) the lifespan successfully reduces the worm&rsquo;s remaining if short; (ii) if the worm has low secondary infectivity, its effect depends on the lifespan; and (iii) if the worm has high secondary infectivity, it is effective without depending on the lifespan.},
