\begin{abstract}
We propose the \emph{Cyberdefense Multi-Agent Systems Development Environment}~\cite{Soule2023} (CybMASDE), a tool for helping in the design, implementation and assessing of cyber-defender agents that tackle cyber-attacker agents in a networked system. It is based on the CybORG simulation and emulation network environment, that enables powering the design phase with agents' training. It aims to bring practical control and assist means from scenario modeling until the deployment of a specified Cyberdefense Multi-Agent System.
First, we introduce CybMASDE and its motivations. Then, we give an technical overview of the CybMASDE functioning. Finally, we discuss about case studies with successful application of CybMASDE.

\section{Introduction}


% Context
%   - application domain
In some heterogenous and distributed systems such as drone swarms, smart cities or company infrastructures, centralized Cyberdefense systems may show limitations to address the increasing complexity of cyber-threats regarding constraints of fast environmental changes, embedded systems, limited human action, unstable communication and so on. Works carried out for \emph{Autonomous Intelligent Cyberdefense Agents} (AICA)~\cite{Kott2023}, have fostered a multi-agent approach of Cyberdefense where cyber-defender collaborative agents are deployed on a networked system making up a Cyberdefense Multi-Agent System (CMAS).
We envision that type of Multi-Agent System (MAS) in a scenario as a blue team that aims to achieve Cyberdefense goals to fight against a red team of cyber-attacker agents and tackle them and their impact on the networked environment and regular users represented as a green team.
That vision falls into the \emph{Autonomous Cyber Operation} (ACO) research works such as in the \emph{Cyber Operation Research Gym}~\cite{Standen2021} (CybORG), an environment for developing and researching in autonomous cyber-agents.

% Problem
%   - problem scenario

Yet, from a developer point-of-view no methodological means have been pushed forward to guide and assist the development a CMAS that ensures intended Cyberdefense in the considered networked system described in a scenario.

% Hypothesis / Contribution:
%   - technology used
%   - the system's innovations

%Based upon CybORG,
We introduce CybMASDE, an interactive tool to help the development process of a CMAS regarding the environmental constraints and Cyberdefense goals. The underlying development approach relies on simulation for designing and filtering relevant CMAS models for a scenario; and emulation for implementing and assessing those models in the real networked system described in the scenario.
% In simulation, means have been set up to take advantage of a bottom-up approach by using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to bring out emergent successful CMAS models or fine-tuning parametrized ones. Those can be analyzed to understand their resulting organization specifications with the help of a behavioral analysis.

% Results

% Even though CybMASDE is at an early development stage, feedbacks received from non expert users in academic and industrial contexts, express its quick utilization for convincing results with few skills required compared to CybORG.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Positioning and contribution}

In literature, we reviewed available Open-source environments suitable for the development of a CMAS. Main requirements focus on the MAS paradigm to benefit from collective AI techniques such as self/re-organization or MARL; and the methodological needs regarding the users' interactions. Results are presented in Table \ref{tab:litterature_review_summary}.

CSLE~\cite{Hammar2022} and CybORG~\cite{Maxwell2021} are the closest environments regarding our requirements. They have a similar simulation/emulation approach that consists in using RL in simulation and validating trained models in emulation. CybORG is fostered because is the only environment that explicitly allows MARL, it comprises a Green Team, and it has a high simulation fidelity that allows to narrow the gap between simulation and reality whereas CSLE builds a simulation model from collected data. Yet, CybORG is not sufficient in itself for addressing a comprehensive development of a CMAS.

In that regard, CybMASDE is mainly motivated by the lack of genericity and acquaintance with our vision of a scenario, the virtual absence of organization-level explanation and design tools, and the weak presence of user interactions means. It should provide practical means for researchers to apply an iterative lifecycle alternating between simulation for pre-designing CMAS models and emulation for validating them.

% In simulation, we integrated our approach to properly model the problem in the scenario by defining the network nodes (router, servers, embedded systems), the green team (as an indicator of the network health) and the red team (such as malware programs, worms inspired from framework such as the MITRE ATT\&CK TTPs). Consequently, the flexibility in simulation, leaves room for designing a CMAS models through various resolution approaches ranging from a fully top-down design to bottom-up mechanisms including MARL techniques. Those are analyzed regarding their emergent organization and quantitatively assessed and filtered according to their cumulative rewards.
% The contribution in emulation is a semi-automated process to reproduce the networked system as a set of networked virtual machines or emulated nodes, and transfer agents of each team into those for validating them in real conditions.

\section{Technical description}

CybMASDE comprises a Python backend comprising 5 modules connected via a REST API to the Angular frontend modules.

The \textquote{\textit{scenario store}} which contains pre-defined json file configurations of nodes, networks, agents, or even all-in-one complete scenarios. Configuration files are compliant to a flexible format enabling the description of various software and hardware characteristics. In frontend, interface allows manual updating and loading of the configuration files in text-editors.

The \textquote{\textit{simulation API}} comprises the endpoints for using the backend modules. It enables updating and loading the configuration library components to compose/use a scenario configuration, creating a simulation or emulation instance and following its execution through analysis tools.

The \textquote{\textit{simulation engine}} is the modified CybORG simulator that runs the simulation instance by instantiating the necessary objects described in the scenario file configuration. It also launches the running of agents and handle the updating of the instantiated environment depending on applied actions. In frontend, it asks to specify the number of episodes and iterations for agents' mechanisms that requires training. It also retrieves and displays real-time and complementary data concerning the running of the execution in order to filtering under performant CMAS models in simulation.

The \textquote{\textit{emulation engine}} that runs the emulation instance by creating and configuring all the nodes described in the configuration file as networked virtual machines. It requires manually provisioning the host machines. It also handles the creation, monitoring and launching the described agents of each team thanks to a success/failure signal system. In frontend, it asks for confirmation of using the generated emulation and deployment YAML plan from backend. That YAML file indicates the operations to be executed for creating the networked environment how agents should be deployed. Then, the data retrieved after launching are also displayed for ultimately filtering successful CMAS models.

The \textquote{\textit{organization specification engine}} is a side-tool for automating the design of a CMAS by generating the suited organization specifications that foster its performance. It relies on MARL for extracting the best suited specified organization models from trained agents behaviors. The agent training can also consists in refining parametrized behavior according to pre-defined MAS architectures such as coalition or hierarchy based. In frontend, it can be selected as an option during the simulation configuration of a scenario to enable the generation of the organization specifications at the end of simulation. It should be preferably chosen when the blue agents' behavior models requires some training, and an overall picture of agents organization is not obvious. These specifications can be exported as a json file for later implementation of MAS models.

\section{Successful utilization}

CybMASDE has been initiated by a student research project as an experimental platform to study the organizational issues of a CMAS regarding given deployment and operational constraints when aiming to reach intended Cyberdefense goals (presentation video in \cite{Soule2023-video}). In that regard, we addressed the third CAGE Challenge\cite{cage_challenge_3_announcement2022} that consist in creating a suited CMAS to protect an ad hoc drone swarm network being cyber-attacked by malware programs for it meets inherent embedded and distributed properties.

% Furthermore, the successful utilization of CybMASDE by non-expert students for fictitious company infrastructures scenarios in projects, have expressed CybMASDE to be a relevant support for fast development of tailored CMAS matching the researchers needs with few required skills by focusing on relevant users' interactions.

Aside of the academic contribution, CybMASDE is also used within an industrial context in a micro-architecture Kubernetes scenario for addressing specific cyber-attacks in pod orchestration. CybMASDE is also to be used for the development of AICA-like CMAS allowing to adapt the theoretical architectural polyvalent vision of an AICA to the deployment and operational constraints of various IoBT related environments.

% CybMASDE is envisioned as an Open Source participative research project to be freely used in research and development contexts.

\section{Conclusion}

CybMASDE was proposed to provide methodological help for designing, implementing and assessing collaborating cyber-defender agents to reach given Cyberdefense goals in distributed embedded systems. Its backend is based upon the CybORG simulation engine to narrow the simulation/reality gap while taking advantage of MARL to generate or refine CMAS models.
Then, those models are transferred in emulation for validation through an iterative simulation/emulation lifecycle. Finally, as an early research project, CybMASDE is in use both in academic and industrial contexts.
