  abstract  = {Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning can lead to the development of collaborative agent behaviors that show similarities with organizational concepts. Pushing forward this perspective, we introduce a novel framework that explicitly incorporates organizational roles and goals from the MOISE+ model into the MARL process, guiding agents to satisfy corresponding organizational constraints. By structuring training with roles and goals, we aim to enhance both the explainability and control of agent behaviors at the organizational level, whereas much of the literature primarily focuses on individual agents. Additionally, our framework includes a post-training analysis method to infer implicit roles and goals, offering insights into emergent agent behaviors. This framework has been applied across various MARL environments and algorithms, demonstrating coherence between predefined organizational specifications and those inferred from trained agents.},

  abstract  = {Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been successfully applied in industry for their ability to address complex, distributed problems, especially in IoT-based systems. Their efficiency in achieving given objectives and meeting design requirements is strongly dependent on the MAS organization during the engineering process of an application-specific MAS. To design a MAS that can achieve given goals, available methods rely on the designer's knowledge of the deployment environment. However, high complexity and low readability in some deployment environments make the application of these methods to be costly or raise safety concerns. In order to ease the MAS organization design regarding those concerns, we introduce an original Assisted MAS Organization Engineering Approach (AOMEA). AOMEA relies on combining a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) process with an organizational model to suggest relevant organizational specifications to help in MAS engineering.},
