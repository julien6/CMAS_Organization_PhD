\justifying

\noindent
I am writing to apply for the position \textit{Postdoctoral Researcher in Model-Based Digital Twin (DC-26064)} at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST).
One of my key research interests is focusing on the \textbf{model-based simulation of complex systems} using \textbf{World Models}~\href{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63223-5_24}{(Ha \textit{et al.}, 2018)}, abstractions (Dec-POMDP), and data-driven components to support \textbf{analysis, scenario exploration, and decision-making} especially in multi-agent contexts.
This perspective closely aligns with LIST’s objectives of developing \textbf{incremental, model-driven Digital Twins} to support system design and operational decision support.

I recently defended \href{https://julien6.github.io/home/#thesis}{\textbf{my PhD}} in Computer Science at \textit{Université Grenoble Alpes} (UGA), conducted in close collaboration with \textit{Thales Land \& Air Systems}.
My doctoral work addressed the modeling, simulation, and analysis of complex systems for \textbf{Multi-Agent Systems (MASs)}, formal modeling, and learning-based components.
I approached these systems as evolving, partially specified environments, where executable models are used from early design stages to explore behaviors, assess trade-offs, and support informed decision-making.

\section*{Background and main contributions}

During \href{https://julien6.github.io/home/#thesis}{\textbf{my PhD}}, I developed a \textbf{methodological framework for the design and analysis of MAS}, implemented in the open-source \href{https://github.com/julien6/CybMASDE}{\textbf{CybMASDE platform}}.
This framework combines formal modeling, simulation, and data-driven analysis to support the full lifecycle of system design, from early conceptualization to executable prototypes.
A central objective of this work is to enable \textbf{incremental Digital Twin development}, even when limited information is available about the final system.

My main contributions can be summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Model-based and multi-agent system design.}
            I proposed a structured approach to modeling complex systems as executable multi-agent simulations, formulating system design as a constrained policy-optimization problem with iterative \textit{design--train--analyze--transfer} cycles.
            This enables early validation of assumptions and systematic exploration of alternative configurations
            \href{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63223-5_24}{\textbf{(Soulé, AIAI~2024)}} and extensions toward a unified model-driven methodology
            \href{https://assets-eu.researchsquare.com/files/rs-7166037/v1_covered_908e23dd-6fb8-4efc-9ef3-a78c4d539bac.pdf?c=1753863562}{\textbf{(Soulé, JAAMAS~2025, under second-round revision)}}.

      \item \textbf{Executable simulations and digital twins.}
            I developed simulation models acting as \textit{digital twins} of complex infrastructures, integrating static and dynamic aspects and remaining executable throughout their evolution.
            These models support what-if analyses, scenario comparison, and system-level evaluation, while enabling safer and data-efficient exploration
            \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122}{\textbf{(Ha, 2018)}}; \href{https://assets-eu.researchsquare.com/files/rs-7166037/v1_covered_908e23dd-6fb8-4efc-9ef3-a78c4d539bac.pdf?c=1753863562}{\textbf{(Soulé, JAAMAS~2025, under second-round revision)}}.

      \item \textbf{Incremental and lifecycle-aware modeling.}
            My work emphasizes model consistency and evolution across the system lifecycle, from early abstractions to more detailed representations.
            This includes managing multiple viewpoints (technical, organizational, operational) and preserving coherence as models evolve, which is central to model-based Digital Twin engineering
            \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21559}{\textbf{(Soulé, IEEE CLOUD~2025)}}.

      \item \textbf{Decision-support, behavior analysis, and explainability.}
            I designed analysis pipelines and unsupervised methods to extract indicators, implicit roles, behavioral patterns, and anomalies from simulation traces and agent trajectories.
            These contributions support decision-making and \textbf{explainable multi-agent learning}, bridging raw simulation outputs and actionable insights
            \href{https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3709347.3743834}{\textbf{(Soulé, AAMAS~2025)}}.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Fit with the model-based Digital Twin project}

The objectives of the Digital Twin activities at LIST, and in particular within the context of the LuxHyVal initiative, strongly resonate with my research trajectory.
They align with a \textbf{central research objective} structuring my work: the design of \textbf{incremental, model-driven Digital Twins that remain executable, coherent, and decision-oriented throughout their lifecycle}, even when information about the final system is incomplete.

Within this objective, I envision my contributions along the following complementary axes:

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Incremental and executable Digital Twin engineering.}
            Contribute to a model-based framework in which executable Digital Twins are available from early design stages and progressively refined as knowledge increases, while preserving consistency across abstraction levels.

      \item \textbf{Integration of heterogeneous concerns.}
            Support the coordination of technical, organizational, and economic viewpoints within the Digital Twin, enabling coherent representations of the hydrogen value chain.

      \item \textbf{Scenario exploration and decision support.}
            Strengthen simulation- and analysis-based capabilities for feasibility assessment, and what-if reasoning, transforming simulation outputs into interpretable decision-support indicators.
            Learning-based approaches could also be explored to optimize operational strategies within the Digital Twin.

      \item \textbf{Model-based foundations with hybrid data-driven approaches.}
            Investigate and strengthen data-driven techniques for Digital Twins (\textbf{World Models}) to approximate unknown dynamics, while preserving interpretability and lifecycle consistency through a \textbf{neuro-symbolic} perspective.

      \item \textbf{Accessible and interactive Digital Twin interfaces.}
            Contribute to visual and interactive tools (dashboards, visual analytics, simulation interfaces) that make Digital Twin outputs accessible and support collective understanding and decision-making.
\end{itemize}




\section*{Collaboration and motivation}

My doctoral research was conducted in close collaboration with industrial partners, giving me a strong appreciation for \textbf{research-to-industry transfer} and the practical constraints associated with deploying research prototypes.
I am accustomed to working at the interface between researchers, engineers, and domain experts.

In this context, I see my contribution to collaborative research projects structured around the following principles:

\begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Expert knowledge elicitation and formalization.}
            Capture and formalize domain expertise into executable and analyzable models that can be shared, discussed, and refined collectively.

      \item \textbf{Iterative and participatory development.}
            Develop models and prototypes iteratively, incorporating stakeholder feedback to ensure their relevance for decision-making.

      \item \textbf{Bridging research and operational needs.}
            Translate research concepts into tools, representations, and workflows usable by non-academic stakeholders.

      \item \textbf{Scientific and technical dissemination.}
            Contribute to scientific publications, technical reports, and project deliverables with both academic rigor and practical impact.
\end{itemize}

More broadly, my motivation is to pursue a research agenda centered on \textbf{model-based Digital Twins as decision-support}, particularly under uncertainty, incomplete information, and long-term societal implications.

The applied and interdisciplinary research environment at LIST, together with its strong involvement in European initiatives such as LuxHyVal, provides an ideal setting to consolidate my expertise while contributing to research supporting the energy transition and related societal challenges.
