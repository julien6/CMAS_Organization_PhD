\noindent {\Large\textbf{Motivations}}\\
\noindent
For more than a decade, the complexity, automation, and speed of cyberattacks have challenged traditional approaches to cyberdefense, which are centralized and primarily reactive or based on fixed rules. In a context where the systems to be defended are themselves becoming distributed and dynamic (microservices architectures, drone swarms, industrial IoT, etc.), defense mechanisms must also become more autonomous, adaptable, and resilient.
The idea of an intelligent cyber defense agent, capable of autonomously detecting and countering threats, has been embodied by the concept of the \acn{AICA}~\cite{Kott2023} agent. The first generation of \acn{AICA} took the form of a \textit{monolithic} agent, equipped with perception, decision-making, and action capabilities within a localized perimeter. The complexity of the situations handled quickly justified a move towards a more explicit and modular architecture, illustrated by the \acn{MASCARA}~\cite{Kott2023} architecture, which proposes a cognitive-type symbolic modular architecture for the \acn{AICA} agent.
In line with this work, this distributed approach evolved into a multi-agent version of the \acn{AICA} concept, in which several agents collaborate to defend a complex system, paving the way for the concept of \acn{SMA} for cyberdefense. This evolution raises many questions: how can we specify an organization that is adapted to environmental constraints and attacks? What capabilities should these agents have and at what cost? How can we ensure that their behavior meets functional (performance, adaptation) and non-functional (safety, explainability) requirements?
\
\bigskip
\noindent {\Large\textbf{Objectives}}\\
\noindent
The overall objective of this thesis is to obtain a Cyber Defense \acn{SMA} capable of adapting to the dynamic constraints of the environment to be defended, while maximizing its ability to detect, prevent, and counter threats.
%
Rather than seeking a single Cyberdefense \acn{SMA} solution to address this complex problem, we aim to establish a design method to guide or assist the process of creating such an \acn{SMA}. This method is intended to be generic and capable of integrating, organizing, and orchestrating the various contributions in a coherent manner.
\noindent
The idea of implementing such a method involves taking several challenges into account:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Modeling the design problem} of the \acn{SMA} to take into account both the cyberdefense objectives and the constraints imposed by the environment or the designer;

  \item \textbf{Reducing the design cost} by partially freeing oneself from dependence on expert knowledge~;
  \item \textbf{Quantitatively evaluating the performance} of the SMA on criteria such as resilience, autonomy, or adaptability~;

  \item \textbf{Ensure explainability} of the overall behavior of the \acn{SMA}, in particular by identifying emerging roles, objectives, and interactions~;
  \item \textbf{Guarantee operational safety and compliance with critical constraints} through organizational control mechanisms~;

  \item \textbf{Enable dynamic adaptation} of the \acn{SMA} in response to changing constraints and situations in the real environment.
\end{itemize}
\noindent
These challenges are guiding research toward a method that covers the design of the \acn{SMA} for cyberdefense by seeking to benefit from the advantages of both connectionist and symbolic approaches.
\
\bigskip
\noindent {\Large\textbf{Targeted contributions}}\\
\noindent
We seek to establish a method for designing \acn{SMA} for \acplu{SMA} in cyber defense. Assuming the necessary simulation, our method can be approached in four activities~:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Modeling}~: creation of a simulated environment either manually following a generic Markovian framework and expert knowledge, or automatically using \acn{ML} techniques that capture the dynamics of the environment from its traces~;
  \item \textbf{Resolution}: obtaining joint multi-agent policies manually or using \acn{ML} techniques under constraints expressed as organizational specifications in particular;
  \item \textbf{Analysis}~: inference of emerging organizational specifications, such as roles or objectives, from the trajectories of agents, using unsupervised learning techniques in particular~;
  \item \textbf{Transfer}: coupling and minimizing the gap between the real environment and the simulated environment in the manner of digital twins by updating the policies of real agents and the simulated environment.
\end{itemize}


\noindent These activities require several contributions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Formalization of the design problem as an optimization problem under the constraints of the environment and designers. On this basis, a formalization of the method can be proposed to formally model the entire processing chain orchestrating all contributions;

  \item A multi-agent extension of \acn{ML} techniques such as \textit{World Models} will capture the dynamics of observational transition, thus enabling the automatic generation of a model simulating the environment as perceived by the agents;
  \item A framework that will provide a generic framework to guide the manual modeling of a real environment as a simulation using expert knowledge;

  \item A framework that will allow the integration of designers' requirements into the policy acquisition process, such as in a \acn{MARL} process where policy learning can be guided or constrained~;
  \item A method for analyzing emerging behaviors, capable of inferring organizational specifications from the trajectories of trained agents~;
  \item A tool implementing the entire method, including the various contributions and its application in several environments for some or all of the activities.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The method will need to be evaluated in representative cyber defense environments. The method may also be evaluated in non-cyber defense environments to demonstrate its generalizability in other multi-agent contexts.

\noindent {\Large\textbf{Manuscript outline}}\\
\noindent
The question of organizing a cyber defense \acn{SMA} first led us to conduct a literature review, the analysis of which highlighted the value of specifying the research question within the framework of an optimization problem. This specified question allows us to structure our approach around a series of hypotheses, combining symbolic and connectionist approaches, which form the basis of the various contributions of the thesis. These contributions are then evaluated experimentally in order to test the validity of the hypotheses and, ultimately, to answer the research question.
\noindent
The manuscript is structured in five parts, each consisting of three to five chapters, as presented in \autoref{fig:manuscript_organization}. This organization follows a progressive reasoning, detailed in \autoref{fig:manuscript_logic}.

\end{figure}
\noindent
The \fullpartref{part:context}{Working Context} introduces the general research question by highlighting the limitations of existing approaches to designing MAS dedicated to cyber defense. It thus motivates the use of a hybrid approach, combining symbolic models and connectionist techniques, and specifies the research question within a constrained optimization framework. This section concludes with a presentation of the hypotheses that will structure the entire study.
%
Based on these hypotheses, the \fullpartref{part:state_of_the_art}{State of the Art} establishes the necessary theoretical foundations and identifies, for each of them, the scientific obstacles that will need to be overcome. It thus constitutes the conceptual basis on which the proposed method will be based.
%
Continuing on from this, the \fullpartref{part:methode}{MAMAD method} describes the \acn{MAMAD} method, designed to answer the research question. It details the four key activities and explains the specific contributions associated with each one.
%
To evaluate the method and validate the underlying hypotheses, the \fullpartref{part:experimentation}{Experimental validation of the method} presents the experimental protocol that was implemented. It describes the environments tested, the evaluation objectives, the metrics used, as well as the results obtained and their comparative analysis.
%
Finally, the \fullpartref{part:conclusion}{Conclusion} provides a summary of the thesis's contributions. It discusses the limitations encountered and outlines several perspectives for extending this work.
