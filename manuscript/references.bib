  abstract  = {Predicting an adversary's capabilities, intentions, and probable vectors of attack is in general a complex and arduous task. Cyber space is particularly vulnerable to unforeseen attacks, as most computer networks have a large, complex, opaque attack surface area and are therefore extremely difficult to analyze. Abstract adversarial models which capture the pertinent features needed for analysis, can reduce the complexity sufficiently to make analysis feasible. Game theory allows for mathematical analysis of adversarial models; however, its scalability limitations restrict its use to simple, abstract models. Computational game theory is focused on scaling classical game theory to large, complex systems capable of modeling real-world environments; one promising approach is coevolution where each player's 'fitness is dependent on its adversaries. In this paper, we propose the Coevolutionary Agent-based Network Defense Lightweight Event System (CANDLES), a framework designed to coevolve attacker and defender agent strategies and evaluate potential solutions with a custom, abstract computer network defense simulation. By performing a qualitative analysis of the result data, we provide a proof of concept for the applicability of coevolution in planning for, and defending against, novel attacker strategies in computer network security.},

  abstract   = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Its computational model is based on dataflow graphs with mutable state. Graph nodes may be mapped to different machines in a cluster, and within each machine to CPUs, GPUs, and other devices. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, but it particularly targets training and inference with deep neural networks. It serves as a platform for research and for deploying machine learning systems across many areas, such as speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, and natural language processing. In this talk, we describe TensorFlow and outline some of its applications. We also discuss the question of what TensorFlow and deep learning may have to do with functional programming. Although TensorFlow is not purely functional, many of its uses are concerned with optimizing functions (during training), then with applying those functions (during inference). These functions are defined as compositions of simple primitives (as is common in functional programming), with internal data representations that are learned rather than manually designed. TensorFlow is joint work with many other people in the Google Brain team and elsewhere. More information is available at tensorflow.org.},

Thus, the relational dependence of roles means that they are defined in the organizations they belong to.},

  abstract  = {Distributed problem solving involves the collective effort of multiple problems solvers to combine their knowledge, information, and capabilities so as to develop solutions to problems that each could not have solved as well (if at all) alone. The challenge in distributed problem solving is thus in marshalling the distributed capabilities in the right ways so that the problem solving activities of each agent complement the activities of the others, so as to lead efficiently to effective solutions. Thus, while working together leads to distributed problem solving, there is also the distributed problem of how to work together that must be solved. We consider that problem to be a distributed planning problem, where each agent must formulate plans for what it will do that take into account (sufficiently well) the plans of other agents. In this paper, we characterize the variations of distributed problem solving and distributed planning, and summarize some of the basic techniques that have been developed to date.},

  abstract  = {Complexity of near future and even nowadays applications is exponentially increasing. In order to tackle the design of such complex systems, being able to engineer self-organising systems is a promising approach. This way, the whole system will autonomously changes its behaviour as its parts locally reorganise themselves, always providing an adapted function. This paper proposes to focus on engineering such systems generating emergent functionalities. We will first define two important concepts to take into account in such a context: Emergence and Self-Organisation. Building on these two concepts, we will highlight three main challenges researchers have to cope with: (i) how to control the system at the macro level by only focusing on the design of agents at the micro level, (ii) what kind of tools, models and guides are needed to develop such systems in order to help designers and (iii) how validation of such systems can be achieved? Each of these three challenges will be explained and positioned in regard to the main existing approaches. Our solutions combining emergence and self-organisation will be expounded for each challenge.},

  abstract  = {Coordination, the process by which an agent reasons about its local actions and the (anticipated) actions of others to try and ensure the community acts in a coherent manner, is perhaps the key problem of the discipline of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). In order to make advances it is important that the theories and principles which guide this central activity are uncovered and analysed in a systematic and rigourous manner. To this end, this paper models agent communities using a distributed goal search formalism, and argues that commitments (pledges to undertake a specific course of action) and conventions (means of monitoring commitments in changing circumstances) are the foundation of coordination in all DAI systems.},

  abstract = {Penetration testing, or pentesting, refers to assessing network system security by trying to identify and exploit any existing vulnerabilities. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently become an effective method for creating autonomous pentesting agents. However, RL agents are typically trained in a simulated network environment. This can be challenging when deploying them in a real network infrastructure due to the lack of realism of the simulation-trained agents. In this paper, we present PenGym, a framework for training pentesting RL agents in realistic network environments. The most significant features of PenGym are its support for real pentesting actions, full automation of the network environment creation, and good execution performance. The results of our experiments demonstrated the advantages and effectiveness of using PenGym as a realistic training environment in comparison with a simulation approach (NASim). For the largest scenario, agents trained in the original NASim environment behaved poorly when tested in a real environment, having a high failure rate. In contrast, agents trained in PenGym successfully reached the pentesting goal in all our trials. Even after fixing logical modeling issues in simulation to create the revised version NASim(rev.), experiment results with the largest scenario indicated that agents trained in PenGym slightly outperformed, and were more stable, than those trained in NASim(rev.). Thus, the average number of steps required to reach the pentesting goal was 1.4 to 8 steps better for PenGym. Consequently, PenGym provides a reliable and realistic training environment for pentesting RL agents, eliminating the need to model agent actions via simulation.},

  abstract  = {A multi-agent system which operates in an open environment must be able to react to unpredictable events. These events lead, at the system level, to possible system's failures and, inside the system, to agents' failures. Each agent performs several roles which could be unfulfilled in the system in case of agents' failures. To overcome these failure situations, agents could have their interactions and/or roles change during the multi-agent system execution. Doing so, we can prevent from system incoherence and possible deadlocks. Hence, we propose in this paper two techniques such that the first techniques allows to operate changes in agents' interactions and the second technique allows to operate changes in agents' roles in order to build adaptive multi-agent systems. We will illustrate our techniques by applying them to a case study: a timetable design.},

@article{SYamaguchi2020,
  abstract       = {A new kind of malware called Mirai is spreading like wildfire. Mirai is characterized by targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Since IoT devices are increasing explosively, it is not realistic to manage their vulnerability by human-wave tactics. This paper proposes a new approach that uses a white-hat worm to fight malware. The white-hat worm is an extension of an IoT worm called Hajime and introduces lifespan and secondary infectivity (the ability to infect a device infected by Mirai). The proposed white-hat worm was expressed as a formal model with agent-oriented Petri nets called PN 2 . The model enables us to simulate a battle between the white-hat worm and Mirai. The result of the simulation evaluation shows that (i) the lifespan successfully reduces the worm&rsquo;s remaining if short; (ii) if the worm has low secondary infectivity, its effect depends on the lifespan; and (iii) if the worm has high secondary infectivity, it is effective without depending on the lifespan.},

  abstract  = {While multi-agent systems seem to provide a good basis for building complex software systems, this paper points out some of the drawbacks of classical ``agent centered'' multi-agent systems. To resolve these difficulties we claim that organization centered multi-agent system, or OCMAS for short, may be used. We propose a set of general principles from which true OCMAS may be designed. One of these principles is not to assume anything about the cognitive capabilities of agents. In order to show how OCMAS models may be designed, we propose a very concise and minimal OCMAS model called AGR, for Agent/Group/Role. We propose a set of notations and a methodological framework to help the designer to build MAS using AGR. We then show that it is possible to design multi-agent systems using only OCMAS models.},
