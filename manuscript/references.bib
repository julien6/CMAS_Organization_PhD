  abstract  = {In this paper, the reasoning and planning capabilities of an autonomous
               mobile robot are described; The reasoning system that controls the
               robot is designed to exhibit the kind of behavior expected of a rational
               agent, and is endowed with the psychological attitudes of belief,
               desire, and intention. Because these attitudes are explicitly represented,
               they can be manipulated and reasoned about, resulting in complex
               goal-directed and reflective behaviors. Unlike most planning systems,
               the plans or intentions formed by the robot need only be partly elaborated
               before it decides to act. This allows the robot to avoid overly strong
               expectations about the environment, overly constrained plans of action,
               and other forms of overcommitment common to previous planners. In
               addition, the robot is continuously reactive and has the ability
               to change its goals and intentions as situations warrant. The system
               has been tested with SRIâ€™s autonomous robot (Flakey) in a space station
               scenario involving navigation and the performance of emergency tasks.},

  abstract  = {Distributed problem solving involves the collective effort of multiple problems solvers to combine their knowledge, information, and capabilities so as to develop solutions to problems that each could not have solved as well (if at all) alone. The challenge in distributed problem solving is thus in marshalling the distributed capabilities in the right ways so that the problem solving activities of each agent complement the activities of the others, so as to lead efficiently to effective solutions. Thus, while working together leads to distributed problem solving, there is also the distributed problem of how to work together that must be solved. We consider that problem to be a distributed planning problem, where each agent must formulate plans for what it will do that take into account (sufficiently well) the plans of other agents. In this paper, we characterize the variations of distributed problem solving and distributed planning, and summarize some of the basic techniques that have been developed to date.},

  abstract  = {Coordination, the process by which an agent reasons about its local actions and the (anticipated) actions of others to try and ensure the community acts in a coherent manner, is perhaps the key problem of the discipline of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI). In order to make advances it is important that the theories and principles which guide this central activity are uncovered and analysed in a systematic and rigourous manner. To this end, this paper models agent communities using a distributed goal search formalism, and argues that commitments (pledges to undertake a specific course of action) and conventions (means of monitoring commitments in changing circumstances) are the foundation of coordination in all DAI systems.}

The proposed reorganisation scheme is evaluated in the robot soccer domain where we have developed players that follow the team organisation specified in {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}M{\}}{\$}oise{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}. A special group of agents may change this organisation, and thus the team behaviour, using reinforcement learning for the selection phase.},

To resolve these difficulties we claim that organization centered multi-agent system, or OCMAS for short, may be used. We propose a set of general principles from which true OCMAS may be designed. One of these principles is not to assume anything about the cognitive capabilities of agents. In order to show how OCMAS models may be designed, we propose a very concise and minimal OCMAS model called AGR, for Agent/Group/Role. We propose a set of notations and a methodological framework to help the designer to build MAS using AGR. We then show that it is possible to design multi-agent systems using only OCMAS models.},

All social concepts depend on descriptions defining them, which are collectively accepted, and the descriptions defining the components of organizations, including roles, are included in the description of the organizations they belong to. Thus, the relational dependence of roles means that they are defined in the organizations they belong to.},

This paper presents a methodology named ADELFE, which is led by the Rational Unified Process (RUP) but is devoted to software engineering of adaptive multi- agent systems. ADELFE guarantees that the software is developed according to the AMAS theory1. We focus this presentation on the additions of ADELFE regarding the three first core workflows of the RUP. Therefore, during the requirements phase, the environment of the studied system must be defined and characterized. Then, in the analysis phase, the engineer is guided to decide to use adaptive multi-agent technology and to identify the agents through the system and the environment models. Finally, the design workflow of ADELFE must provide the cooperative agent's model and helps the developer to define the local agents. behavior. We illustrate the methodology by applying it to a case study: a timetable design.},

  abstract       = {The world is transitioning from the conventional grid to the smart grid at a rapid pace. Innovation always comes with some flaws; such is the case with a smart grid. One of the major challenges in the smart grid is to protect it from potential cyberattacks. There are millions of sensors continuously sending and receiving data packets over the network, so managing such a gigantic network is the biggest challenge. Any cyberattack can damage the key elements, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the smart grid. The overall smart grid network is comprised of customers accessing the network, communication network of the smart devices and sensors, and the people managing the network (decision makers); all three of these levels are vulnerable to cyberattacks. In this survey, we explore various threats and vulnerabilities that can affect the key elements of cybersecurity in the smart grid network and then present the security measures to avert those threats and vulnerabilities at three different levels. In addition to that, we suggest techniques to minimize the chances of cyberattack at all three levels.},

  abstract  = {Current frameworks for training offensive penetration testing agents with deep reinforcement learning struggle to produce agents that perform well in real-world scenarios, due to the reality gap in simulation-based frameworks and the lack of scalability in emulation-based frameworks. Additionally, existing frameworks often use an unrealistic metric that measures the agents' performance on the training data. NASimEmu, a new framework introduced in this paper, addresses these issues by providing both a simulator and an emulator with a shared interface. This approach allows agents to be trained in simulation and deployed in the emulator, thus verifying the realism of the used abstraction. Our framework promotes the development of general agents that can transfer to novel scenarios unseen during their training. For the simulation part, we adopt an existing simulator NASim and enhance its realism. The emulator is implemented with industry-level tools, such as Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Metasploit. Experiments demonstrate that a simulation-trained agent can be deployed in emulation, and we show how to use the framework to train a general agent that transfers into novel, structurally different scenarios. NASimEmu is available as open-source.},

  abstract  = {A multi-agent system which operates in an open environment must be able to react to unpredictable events. These events lead, at the system level, to possible system's failures and, inside the system, to agents' failures. Each agent performs several roles which could be unfulfilled in the system in case of agents' failures. To overcome these failure situations, agents could have their interactions and/or roles change during the multi-agent system execution. Doing so, we can prevent from system incoherence and possible deadlocks. Hence, we propose in this paper two techniques such that the first techniques allows to operate changes in agents' interactions and the second technique allows to operate changes in agents' roles in order to build adaptive multi-agent systems. We will illustrate our techniques by applying them to a case study: a timetable design.},

  abstract = {The Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is a promising approach for modeling distributed reasoning tasks that arise in multiagent systems. Unfortunately, existing methods for DCOP are not able to provide theoretical guarantees on global solution quality while allowing agents to operate asynchronously. We show how this failure can be remedied by allowing agents to make local decisions based on conservative cost estimates rather than relying on global certainty as previous approaches have done. This novel approach results in a polynomial-space algorithm for DCOP named Adopt that is guaranteed to find the globally optimal solution while allowing agents to execute asynchronously and in parallel. Detailed experimental results show that on benchmark problems Adopt obtains speedups of several orders of magnitude over other approaches. Adopt can also perform bounded-error approximation—it has the ability to quickly find approximate solutions and, unlike heuristic search methods, still maintain a theoretical guarantee on solution quality.}

  abstract = {Security is an important issue for the widespread deployment of applications based on software agent technology. It is generally agreed that without the proper countermeasures in place, use of agent-based applications will be severely impeded. However, not all applications require the same set of countermeasures, nor can they depend entirely on the agent system to provide them. Instead, countermeasures are applied commensurate with the anticipated threat profile and intended security objectives for the application. While countermeasures typically include any action, device, procedure, technique, or other measure that reduces the vulnerability of or threat to a system, our focus here is specifically on technical mechanisms, as opposed to procedural or non-technical measures. Such countermeasures can be integrated directly into an agent system, or incorporated into the design of an agent to supplement the capabilities of an underlying agent system. This paper gives an overview of the threats associated with software agent systems and their technical countermeasures, including the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques involved. Emphasis is on mobile software agents, since they typically face a more severe set of threats than do static agents and, therefore, demand more rigorous countermeasures.}

In order to tackle the design of such complex systems, being able to engineer self-organising systems is a promising approach. This way, the whole system will autonomously changes its behaviour as its parts locally reorganise themselves, always providing an adapted function. This paper proposes to focus on engineering such systems generating emergent functionalities. We will first define two important concepts to take into account in such a context: Emergence and Self-Organisation. Building on these two concepts, we will highlight three main challenges researchers have to cope with: (i) how to control the system at the macro level by only focusing on the design of agents at the micro level, (ii) what kind of tools, models and guides are needed to develop such systems in order to help designers and (iii) how validation of such systems can be achieved? Each of these three challenges will be explained and positioned in regard to the main existing approaches. Our solutions combining emergence and self-organisation will be expounded for each challenge.},

  abstract  = {Multi-agent robotic systems are increasingly operating in real-world environments in close proximity to humans, yet are largely controlled by policy models with inscrutable deep neural network representations. We introduce a method for incorporating interpretable concepts from a domain expert into models trained through multi-agent reinforcement learning, by requiring the model to first predict such concepts then utilize them for decision making. This allows an expert to both reason about the resulting concept policy models in terms of these high-level concepts at run-time, as well as intervene and correct mispredictions to improve performance. We show that this yields improved interpretability and training stability, with benefits to policy performance and sample efficiency in a simulated and real-world cooperative-competitive multi-agent game.}

Agents are also being used as an overarching framework for bringing together the component AI sub-disciplines that are necessary to design and build intelligent entities. Despite this intense interest, however, a number of fundamental questions about the nature and the use of agents remain unanswered. In particular:what is the essence of agent-based computing?what makes agents an appealing and powerful conceptual model?what are the drawbacks of adopting an agent-oriented approach?what are the wider implications for AI of agent-based computing?},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Social dilemmas have been widely studied to explain how humans are able to cooperate in society. Considerable effort has been invested in designing artificial agents for social dilemmas that incorporate explicit agent motivations that are chosen to favor coordinated or cooperative responses. The prevalence of this general approach points towards the importance of achieving an understanding of both an agent's internal design and external environment dynamics that facilitate cooperative behavior. In this paper, we investigate how partner selection can promote cooperative behavior between agents who are trained to maximize a purely selfish objective function. Our experiments reveal that agents trained with this dynamic learn a strategy that retaliates against defectors while promoting cooperation with other agents resulting in a prosocial society},

In order to prove our point, we will introduce Optuna, an optimization software which is a culmination of our effort in the development of a next generation optimization software. As an optimization software designed with define-by-run principle, Optuna is particularly the first of its kind. We will present the design-techniques that became necessary in the development of the software that meets the above criteria, and demonstrate the power of our new design through experimental results and real world applications.

Unlike previous models which focus on the impact of attackers' actions on the defender's infrastructure, this work focuses on the attackers' strategies and actions. By operating on a requestresponse session level, our model provides an abstraction of how the network infrastructure reacts to access credentials the adversary might have obtained through a variety of strategies. We present the current capabilities of the simulator by showing three variants of Bronze Butler {APT} on a network with different user access levels.},

Our work is based on empirical studies, involving over 100 practitioners, and an evaluation of current support. We introduce the distinction between pre-requirements specification (pre-RS) traceability and post-requirements specification (post-RS) traceability, to demonstrate why an all-encompassing solution to the problem is unlikely, and to provide a framework through which to understand its multifaceted nature. We report how the majority of the problems attributed to poor requirements traceability are due to inadequate pre-RS traceability and show the fundamental need for improvements here. In the remainder of the paper, we present an analysis of the main barriers confronting such improvements in practice, identify relevant areas in which advances have been (or can be) made, and make recommendations for research.},

The formalism models the attacker and defender as competing players that can observe a specific subset of the net and act by changing the transition firing rates that the respective player can control. This model of the attack was based on the Common Attack Pattern and Enumeration Classification database and was validated by a panel of subject matter experts to be representative of a structured query language injection attack. The model was simulated with a reinforcement learning algorithm using an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}upvarepsilon {\$}{\$}-greedy selection method. The algorithm learned within each iteration an optimal solution by varying player-controlled transitions rates. This paper describes the validation of the model, the design of the algorithm, and the results from 4 different {\$}{\$}{\backslash}upvarepsilon {\$}{\$}-values.},

  abstract       = {A new kind of malware called Mirai is spreading like wildfire. Mirai is characterized by targeting Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Since IoT devices are increasing explosively, it is not realistic to manage their vulnerability by human-wave tactics. This paper proposes a new approach that uses a white-hat worm to fight malware. The white-hat worm is an extension of an IoT worm called Hajime and introduces lifespan and secondary infectivity (the ability to infect a device infected by Mirai). The proposed white-hat worm was expressed as a formal model with agent-oriented Petri nets called PN 2 . The model enables us to simulate a battle between the white-hat worm and Mirai. The result of the simulation evaluation shows that (i) the lifespan successfully reduces the worm&rsquo;s remaining if short; (ii) if the worm has low secondary infectivity, its effect depends on the lifespan; and (iii) if the worm has high secondary infectivity, it is effective without depending on the lifespan.},

Unlike previous models which focus on the impact of attackers’ actions on the defender’s infrastructure, this work focuses on the attackers’ strategies and actions. By operating on a requestresponse session level, our model provides an abstraction of how the network infrastructure reacts to access credentials the adversary might have obtained through a variety of strategies. We present the current capabilities of the simulator by showing three variants of Bronze Butler {APT} on a network with different user access levels.},

Our work is based on empirical studies, involving over 100 practitioners, and an evaluation of current support. We introduce the distinction between pre-requirements specification (pre-RS) traceability and post-requirements specification (post-RS) traceability, to demonstrate why an all-encompassing solution to the problem is unlikely, and to provide a framework through which to understand its multifaceted nature. We report how the majority of the problems attributed to poor requirements traceability are due to inadequate pre-RS traceability and show the fundamental need for improvements here.

Unlike previous models which focus on the impact of attackers’ actions on the defender’s infrastructure, this work focuses on the attackers’ strategies and actions. By operating on a requestresponse session level, our model provides an abstraction of how the network infrastructure reacts to access credentials the adversary might have obtained through a variety of strategies. We present the current capabilities of the simulator by showing three variants of Bronze Butler {APT} on a network with different user access levels.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate and discuss the underlying nature of the requirements traceability problem. Our work is based on empirical studies, involving over 100 practitioners, and an evaluation of current support. We introduce the distinction between pre-requirements specification (pre-RS) traceability and post-requirements specification (post-RS) traceability, to demonstrate why an all-encompassing solution to the problem is unlikely, and to provide a framework through which to understand its multifaceted nature. We report how the majority of the problems attributed to poor requirements traceability are due to inadequate pre-RS traceability and show the fundamental need for improvements here. In the remainder of the paper, we present an analysis of the main barriers confronting such improvements in practice, identify relevant areas in which advances have been (or can be) made, and make recommendations for research.},
